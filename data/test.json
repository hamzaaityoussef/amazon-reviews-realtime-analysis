For years I used seemingly indestructable guitar cables that were made for me by an electrician friend.  When they finally gave out, I got in the habit of using the no-name cables that are always on display near the register at Guitar Center- really more of an impulse buy than something I put any thought into.  After the third or fourth Guitar Center cable failed from light use I decided to try these cables.  Not only are they cheaper but they seem to be holding up better.  I am not terribly hard on my gear but my cables tend to get twisted as I move around and the cheaper ones  eventually fail mid-cable.  I don't mind spending a few extra dollars if the cable is a little more durable.  This cable is actually cheaper- $12 or so shipped- and it's holding up pretty well.  These are actually very reasonably priced for 18' cables.  There is some kind of limited life warantee on this product but I haven't needed it.  Five stars for a nicely made 18 foot guitar cable that costs $12 shipped!Incidentally- these cables are shielded and are meant to connect your instrument to your amp's input.  Do not use these to connect an amplifier to a speaker cab.  You want to use unshielded cables for that purpose.Edit-  More than 6 months has passed and this cable is functioning without any issues.  The price on these things has gone up significantly and although the cable is highly recommended, there are probably better values from Hosa, Monster or Planet Waves-","summary":"So far so good.

Vasser","helpful":"[73, 76]","reviewText":"Although this mic is now considered primarily an instrument mic, that was not always the case and I've actually preferred this same basic design for live vocal use since 1970 when I bought my first one which was then known as a \"Shure Model 545 Unidyne III.\"  That mic got stolen about 2 years ago, but remarkably was still working at the time it got boosted and I was still using it when I needed one with an on/off switch function.  I've owned or used countless modern day SM-58's and SM-57's along with dozens of other mics over the years from all manufacturers.  I have a fairly deep baritone to bass type voice and I don't need to get closer than about 7 or 8 inches to a SM-57.  To me the SM-57 sounds similar to the $469 Shure SM-7 studio vocal mic if you put a windscreen on it and get about 2 inches away.  I'd only use an SM-7 in a studio environment though because they are slightly more fragile and over four times as expensive.  By design the SM-58's require you to get much closer to the mic to get a full range sound than with the SM-57's.  I prefer the SM-57's over the SM-58's for vocal use because they sound crisper on the highs and they sound fuller on the low end.  The SM-57 sounds more natural on vocals and never sounds muddy or muffled.  The SM-57 has one of the most pronounced proximity effects of any mic I've ever used.  If you tend to shove the mic down your throat you may benefit from the less dramatic proximity effect of the SM-58.  If you are ever going to use an SM-57 for vocals I'd recommend buying the Shure A2WS windscreen with it.  That genuine Shure windscreen fits precisely and locks securely onto the SM-57.  The SM-57 will pop like mad without one.  The only possible drawback to the SM57 as a vocal mic is that there is no model available with an on/off switch these days.  I can't find a modern SM-57 with a switch anywhere.  However, if you've ever tried using a mic when you forgot that the switch was in the off position it probably just became a liability. For my money, the SM-57 is the best all around microphone of the past two generations for stage use and some recording purposes.  For studio vocals I'd use an SM-7, which really doesn't sound all that much different from the SM-57 when the built-in variable EQ on the SM-7 is set the way I like.  The SM-57 and it's predecessors are to me the best all around microphone since 1970 and certainly the most enduring and durable.

Edwards","helpful":"[3, 4]","reviewText":"While the Shure SM58LC Shure SM58 Vocal Microphone seems to be the running staple for live performance vocals, and rightly so due to its comparative value and amazing quality in sound and craftsmanship, the Beta 58A needs to be given its due. The Beta 58A is an amazing dynamic microphone that might alleviate some of the stress associated with its more cost efficient cousin. That is, the Beta 58A, in the confined live scenarios in which I have utilized it, has demonstrated a much broader sweet spot and completely eliminated some severe feedback issues. For vocalists that like to pull back from the mic a touch to really belt those sustained high (or, really, any) notes the Beta is a dream. This same effect helps if one is experiencing sibilance or \"popping\" complications and needs to sing past the microphone as opposed to directly into it.While I wish that I had a better understanding from a sound engineering standpoint so that the technical specifics could be expounded upon, I can confidently say that the Beta 58A is the best vocals microphone that I have ever utilized aside from higher end condenser mics in an isolated environment. Quite honestly, I would not be at all surprised if the Beta compared well even in confined recording situations. The bottom line is that the Beta 58A might be more expensive than its popular cousin, the SM58, but it is worth every penny. Anyone who has the opportunity should give it a chance to demonstrate its superiority. Six out of five stars!","summary":"Beyond fantastic!","unixReviewTime":1248134400,"reviewTime":"07 21, 2009"}

As a general purpose workhorse for live vocals they are by far the most popular tools out there. Quality venues throughout the country commonly stock these as their go-to house mics. In fact, I noticed Betas all over the place at a small theater (with a high-end system) that I played at just recently.I had used the old 58 for years before moving to the Beta and there is certainly a noticeable difference between the two. The Beta is definitetly hotter, with a more sensitive response. Your vocals will cut into the mix strongly and with more clarity than you might be used to. Mids and highs are picked up perfectly when singing a few inches away and there is a subtle low frequency roll-off to avoid that boomy, muddled sound you typically get when hitting low or quiet notes up close. You definitely need to stay within a close range though as the pickup pattern is very tight. This is a good thing because extraneous noise and feedback is effectively rejected.\"Built like a tank\" is probably a bit overused when describing products but Shure's vocal mics truly earn that title. They can take an enormous amount of abuse and never falter. Toss it around, drop it, bury it under other stuff, etc., NO problem. When you are maintaining a bunch of music gear, it's nice to have tools that you never worry about. For that reason, I'd highly recommend getting a used one if you can find a deal.

I've had it just over a month, so Amazon won't help me. Despite the lifetime warranty, Amazon has only offered to let me pay shipping and to give me a partial refund. Despite being an \"authorized retailer\" for Planet Waves, AMAZON DOES NOT OFFER EXCHANGE UNDER THE PLANET WAVES WARRANTY beyond the standard Amazon 30 day return policy. Amazon support referred me to the manufacturer. I've emailed Planet Waves, but the instructions for the warranty are to return it to a dealer for exchange. I don't have a dealer within 100 miles of my home, so unless the manufacturer comes through, this one is quickly becoming unusable and it looks like it might cost me to resolve it.I frequently switch instruments and this makes it easy to do quietly. I've used cables with the G&H; quiet plug (which also works well), but the switched connector on this has an advantage over the G&H-; you can use it as a mute and tune with a head stock tuner without unplugging your instrument. The cable itself is a bit stiffer than I'm used to, which makes coiling for storage very easy, but it can quickly become a twisted mess on stage if you more length than you really need. The little elastic cord keeper strap works better than I could ever have imagined. I've never given the sound of a cable a thought, being a bass player who doesn't use much for effects and who plays mostly passive instruments. But using this with my Genz Benz Shuttlemax 9.2 and fEARful 15/6/1 cab, I really notice a pronounced difference in clarity and dynamics. The sound is much more alive with this over any of the other cables I have from a variety of manufacturers (Hosa, Proco, Whirlwind, etc). I've never had to warranty exchange a PW cable, but others tout the easy swap at any PW dealer as a great reason to buy them. I like knowing that. ** EDIT: AS STATED ABOVE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE IT THROUGH AMAZON BEYOND 30 DAYS **","summary":"Great design - love the switch","unixReviewTime":1368230400,"reviewTime":"05 11, 2013"}

There are so many players more concerned with the name on the headstock of their guitar and their amp and the endless \"boutique\" pedals in their collections that many seem unable or unwilling to give a listen to \"stock\" gear, or anything that doesn't cost an arm and a leg.The fact is that if you're a gigging musician, and I am, you come to realize that all those subtle, detailed nuances of tone that so many want to obsess over get lost in the band mix, and in the poor acoustics of wherever you're playing.  Yes, we want to sound good to ourselves because that's inspiring, but frankly, I don't need $200+ dollar distortion/OD pedals to be inspired.I haven't owned a DS-1 in a long time, but recently got one because I was looking for a distortion pedal on a budget.  Frankly, I'd forgotten how musical this pedal is.  With the distortion set to minimum (it never gets clean) it's a good, moderate-gain overdrive that still lets your guitar's basic tone get through.  I play a strat & and jazzmaster - those guitars still sound like themselves with this thing.  With the gain at halfway you get great AD/DC crunch.  And even with the gain maxed out you still get excellent note definition on chords.  What more could you want?  Sure, it's \"old school\" rock distortion. The usual \"may not appeal to metalheads\" caveat applies, maybe. Combine this with an eq and you could scoop the mids as much as you want.I also have a Barber LTD (great, relatively cheap \"boutique\" moderate gain OD that doesn't break the bank) and a Visual Sound Route 66, which is a tubescreamer clone (with much more gain) and a compressor in one pedal.  Both the LTD & Rt 66 have the usual TS9 midrange hump, though much less pronounced on the LTD.  What's refreshing about the DS-1 is that the strong mids are there, but the overall tone is not in the same realm as a tubescreamer, so it can sit well on a pedalboard and bring a different flavor to the party.  The tone on the DS-1 can get very bright, but as I indicated I play with single coils, and I have no problem finding sweet spots on the tone knob - I generally run it around 9-10:00.Overall this pedal is a steal - look around and find a used one for a good price. I'd considered a modtone Speedbox, but decided to go with the generally bulletproof Boss instead, for basically the same price.  I couldn't be happier.","summary":"Does what it's supposed to do very well","unixReviewTime":1298592000,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2011"}

If you're a beginner looking for a first guitar or if you're experienced and are searching for a backup/travel option or anything like that, get this. Do not hesitate. A cheap guitar doesn't ALWAYS mean a POS!Alright, full story/review:So, when I was a kid up until my early teens my (insanely talented and self-taught) older brother helped me learn how to play guitar. I got pretty decent but somewhere along the way I stopped and I've regretted it basically every day ever since then. Recently, I decided to stop internally griping about it and realized I should actually DO something about it. So, here I am.Having previously lived in a house with multiple guitarists, I have heard the sounds of expensive guitars and I have heard the sounds of the cheapest guitars (like a typical beginner's First Act). I knew there was a middle ground and I was determined to find it. I got way more than I bargained for.I began my quest knowing that my funds were limited. There was no way I could afford to dive right in and buy a high end, top of the line Fender or Martin like I had had the benefit of learning on back in the day. I knew I had to go cheap, at least for now. I began scouring the internet in search of the best rated budget guitars. After an exhaustive amount of research, I chose this one due to the positive reviews and because all of the demos I'd pulled up on YouTube were excellent. Plus, Epiphone has a pretty good reputation in general.Despite the positive reviews, I was still a bit leery; buying instruments without actually handling them first is always a bit of a gamble. Even if it sounds nice and plays well, sometimes a perfectly solid, functional instrument just doesn't FEEL right. As I went through the checkout I silently reminded myself that I could send it back for any reason. I went into this fully knowing that there was a good possibility I'd just have to bite the bullet and buy something better, even if costlier.Well, it arrived earlier this week and I am not disappointed. I certainly didn't expect perfection and I was convinced that I would find some kind of error, if only cosmetic, with such a cheap guitar. I am here to tell you that I have not found anything wrong with it. Even if I had (unless it drastically affected the sound/playability of the instrument), it would still be worth the price.Along with the guitar I bought some new strings (Martins) because 9/10 times the stock strings that come on instruments are awful. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the stock strings are more than usable. I see that some of the other reviewers disagree. Maybe their strings were older or maybe it's just preference, I don't know. All I can say is that the stock strings on my guitar were not at all corroded/old. Shockingly enough, the guitar was pretty close to being in tune right out of the box! It doesn't seem to have any trouble staying in tune, either. All of that being said, it wouldn't hurt to pick up a pack of strings just to be safe. I mean, I'm sure that when I do finally put the Martins on I'll be even more mind-blown than I already am with the way it sounds.This guitar has a full, rich sound, plays comfortably (the low action helps!), and has zero issues with buzzing or dead frets. Oh, and contrary to what other reviews have said - YES, it DOES have a truss rod. While we're talking about its positives, let's not ignore the fact that it's also super attractive with its shiny black finish. There isn't much about it that would give away its price. No, it's not a $1000 guitar but it certainly doesn't play like a $100 guitar either! I don't regret this purchase at all. Even in the future when I progress and upgrade I will definitely be keeping this lovely gem!If you're still unsure, do what I did and listen to some demos on YouTube. I doubt you'll be disappointed. (Pay no mind to the reviews the guy on the GearWire YouTube channel did. He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about and I, as well as everyone else in the comments section, was sure to express my feelings about that, haha! One user even claimed Epiphone should sue him!) Check out the video reviews by the users/companies GoldHat3, SamAshMusic, GigGear, and ShadowFW.My only complaint about this guitar is that I didn't buy it sooner!Good luck on your search, I hope this review has helped!","summary":"This will more than suffice","unixReviewTime":1376006400,"reviewTime":"08 9, 2013"}

If you play at a fairly consistent sound level you can expect more of a bright sound than a resonant one.On the other hand, compared to some other brands with more of a dampened sound, the brightness can make an instrument sound quite good.Depending on your style, these might be a good choice. If you are used to playing a solid body electric with a lighter feel to the strings that make medium strings uncomfortable, these might seem more at home.  If you are used to Martin medium strings, but want something that you can play for a few extra hours a day without feeling as if you are overdoing things, you might like these too, but when you pick up a guitar with the Martin Medium strings, you may find that even a cheaper guitar sounds better in comparison to these on a more upscale one.I wouldn't say I dislike these, and I wouldn't quite say that those who gave it five stars oversold them, because they may deserve five stars for your particular needs. But as an all around choice, there are better sounding ones from Martin. But it's a moot point if you don't feel comfortable playing them. Make sure to read a variety of reviews before deciding because there are other equally valid viewpoints just as each player is unique.","summary":"A lightweight contender","unixReviewTime":1308614400,"reviewTime":"06 21, 2011"}

Why? After messing about I found that the player is able to fully control the pick and not let the pick interfere with input and attack.  The interference with a thin or medium pick is that it has give, or slackens when attacking hard. With a heavy gauge pick that lack of rigidity or slack is only introduced by the player and not through the picks flexibility.I tried it and liked it and have been using heavy gauge picks since the mid '80's.I like the Dunlops feel, grip, and durability. They hold up for a very long time. How long? I have had some last a few years.

It would not work for an f-hole archtop or other types of instruments such as mandolin or ukulele.  Inside the sturdy plastic case is what appears to be an ordinary kitchen sponge.  If you use distilled water (as recommended) it should last quite a while.  The top comes off with a gentle press on the sides.  The dry sponge can be a little difficult to remove with fingers but tweezers or needle nose pliers work perfectly.  Don't push it all the way in after moistening and you won't have a problem.  I drip a little distilled water on the sponge, squeeze out any excess, and the assembled case pops in easily between the D and G strings, suspended in the middle of the sound hole.  They can't be seen in the photo but there are small ridges on each side that hold the top in place against the strings.  I've never had one of these move from where I left it.If the sponge isn't dripping wet you should never have a problem with drops of water in the guitar or case.  When the humidity is very low (30% or less) the sponge dries out in 2 to 3 days even if the case isn't opened.  As with most humidifiers of this type you will have to check every few days.If you have ever had a crack appear in the top of favorite guitar (or don't want to see one) use a guitar humidifier!  Especially during the winter - heating a house tends to drop the indoor humidity below safe levels (between 45% and 60% is ideal for most guitars).  Air conditioning can do the same.  For especially valuable guitars it would be worth buying a hygrometer to keep in the case but for most guitars having one in the room where you keep you guitar(s) is okay.  For many reasons it's always best to keep your guitar in a case or gig bag when not in use.

Mind you this is not a boutique pedal so there is a tiny bit of noise at full volume but not to the point it is noticeable.This pedal has a cool 1950's style & appearance.

If you're in the market for a great 7 band EQ pedal, then you'll be hard pressed to find one for the price of this one.This product rates 5 out of 5 possible stars.","summary":"Five Stars Without Hiss or Hum","unixReviewTime":1299283200,"reviewTime":"03 5, 2011"}

Yes, it could be metal, and I wish the button gave a satisfying 'click' when I step on it.  For under thirty clams I can look past these things.  I have not had any issues with noise (crackling or oscillation).  I really have no complaints at all with it's performance so I am glad I didn't shell out 3-4X more money so I can feel more secure when I unlatch my pedal board in front of gear-snobs.  I don't think I need to run this pedal with every amp I own but it does a great job 'opening up the sound' of boxy or dark sounding amps.  When I run it in the effects loop of my Palomino V8 (great little practice amp btw) that little amp sounds HUGE.  Also great in front of my Blues Jr.  If you own an amp with a single tone knob (Pro Jr, Valve Jr etc) or if you find your tone stack lacking responsiveness you owe it to yourself to buy one of these. Even if you are satisfied with the responsiveness of your amp's controls, this pedal can double as a volume boost when playing lead.  Once my sound is dialed in, I leave typically leave it on and forget about it.  It's also pretty indespensible for shaping the sound of your amplified acoustic guitar-","summary":"GREAT PEDAL FOR THE MONEY","unixReviewTime":1311811200,"reviewTime":"07 28, 2011"}

At first I was skeptical because it's lightweight and the cutting ends are not sharp. I was wondering how well it could cut the loose ends of strings. I'm happy to say that it does an excellent job, much better than the pair of diagonal pliers I was using.  It cuts the ends of strings easily and cleanly.  It's nice not having to carry the pliers around, which are heavier and a little risky to your guitar should you happen to drop it or accidentally mar your headstock. As for the bridge pin puller, I tried it once but it is rather ineffective. I think it was included more as an afterthought as it's just a notched edge and can't really pull stuck pins. For pulling bridge pins without damaging the bridge I would recommend the Dunlop bridge pin puller which is inexpensive.Overall I give this 5 stars for the winder and cutter.

Harriger\"","helpful":"[0, 1]","reviewText":"I hesitate to write this review simply because it's pretty obvious nearly everyone else loves these strings. To be honest, I was very, very impressed with their feel and handling. I do think they're the best playing strings I've used when it comes to pure playability. Hands down, none better. They were butter-smooth and great for flat picking. But for me it was a trade-off, because I simply wasn't impressed with the tone. I even took the time to try them on three different guitars (all dreadnoughts): a classic maple sides/spruce top, a mahogany back/sides with spruce top, and a maple backs/sides with a nato top. On all three, I didn't like the tone as much as the strings I was using. I really wanted to like them, but they simply didn't have the tone of the medium gauge Martin SPs I normally use.This isn't to say they're not great strings that sound different on other peoples' guitars, but I simply didn't like them on mine. I love good projection with rich bass tones and ringing treble for the folk and traditional music I play in our jam group. The Elixirs just lacked the punchy high tones of the Martin strings I use, and the treble sounds tinny vs. the clear ring of the Martins I normally use. To be fair, the bass strings sound great, and aren't much different. I would have to say choose your strings carefully based upon how you're going to use them. I play in acoustic groups, and the Elixir strings just don't have what I need to be heard, in spite of how great they feel under your fingers. If playability is more important than great tonal range, then by all means buy these strings...you won't be disappointed. I'm guessing these would be fine on an acoustic electric, where the electronics could compensate for the weaker treble tones.","summary":"Great feel and handling, but not the sound I like","unixReviewTime":1391558400,"reviewTime":"02 5, 2014"}

Swanson","helpful":"[6, 9]","reviewText":"After all these reviews I expected the Greatest Strings Ever, golden strands of Glory that would last for a year with sparkling tonal perfection!Instead, I got a decent set of .10's that lasted a whole hour before the D snapped at the neck pickup. I use a PRS with a Wilkinson bridge that rarely breaks strings, and I pre-stretch them gently but completely. Plus I tune down to Eb for vocal and breakage reasons, so I break very few of my normal strings, Slinky .10's. Ergo, a break in one hour from a thick string under minimal tension, tuned down, is unacceptable, especially when these strings cost three times as much as most all other electric strings.As for the tone, it's definitely bright and almost too edgy, but nicely zingy all told. Yet one negative I've noticed after about 8 hours' loud playing with a drummer is that these things seem to vibrate more widely than most strings, making them harder to tune. Sounds odd, I know, but when I replaced the D with a Slinky D (replacing singles ain't cheap either at triple the price, please note), I've since noticed that it tunes faster and in a tighter range than the Elixir strings.So, I must say I'm summarily unimpressed so far with Elixir electric strings.What's the good of string lasting a long time if it breaks fast?Especially when it costs three times more?And what's up with the tuning thing?And why do these cost so much more, anyhow? Is a micro-thin coating of siliconish stuff really worth two bucks extra each string? Not when that string is toast in 50 minutes, zero doubt there.Anyhow, I've got five Elixirs and one Slinky on my main ax now, so as they age I'll get a good feel for how the Elixirs stay in tune and hold their tone, and I'll report back here in a while. And by the way, that Slinky D sounds almost exactly the same as the Elixirs, tonally. So much for Magic Elixir Tone.Don't get me wrong, I really do want to love these, as I hate changing strings, but geez guys, how about some quality control?If I'm going to pay triple the price, then is it crazy to expect triple the quality? Or heck, even just a little better...PS If you look at the D'Addario reviews (I love their acoustic strings), they respond to many of the reviews and questions. I hope that Elixir will do the same here and address my questions.[Edit: And now, after only six hours' of playing on that guitar, the B string popped at the same place as the D, neck pickup. Once again I ask: what good are strings that \"sound good three times longer\" if they break three times faster?][Edit: 10/31/12. Come on! After four more hours, the A string went. I only play that ax one or two sessions a week, and the next time I joked to the drummer, \"Which one will go today?\" He said he's amazed the G is still on, as he plays too and knows the G takes the most tension. An hour later, guess what? Yep. So that's four broken strings in less than 20 hours' play. Seriously?Not only are these not a good deal for 9 bucks, I'd be bummed if they cost 3 bucks. The only plus I can think of at this point is they sounded good when new, but dang, unless you play totally smooth jazz or some such, I'd stick with Slinkies or D'Addarios. Unless I got a \"bad set\", which seems kinda lame for triple the normal price. In any case, these Elixirs were just not worth the money.][Edit, 3/3/13: I called Elixir and told them about the multiple breakage, and they sent me another set. That set has taken a few four hour hard rock sessions with no breaks yet, thought the tuning issue remains. I'll add a star for good customer service and the hope that perhaps my first set was a dud. But honestly, at this price, there should be no duds at all.]","summary":"Not very impressed so far","unixReviewTime":1347235200,"reviewTime":"09 10, 2012"}

When it arrived the instructions were not clear, but I sat the dial to #2, loosened all of the lugs on my floor tom and went around my lugs using opposing lug patterns, and tested the first cut of tuning. Too loose and deep, so I increased the setting to #3 and repeated.  Almost the sound I wanted, so I used a regular key and went an eighth turn using the same pattern.  Perfect.  I then started on the next largest tom, working back to the smallest.  Using the #3 setting plus an eighth turn I got my toms 1/2 octave apart.Next I worked on my snare drum, starting with the snare side, then the batter side. I used #4 on the batter side and #5 on the snare side, and managed to get the crisp, yet warm, sound I wanted. The bass drum came next - I set the batter side tension 1 notch below the resonant side and achieve a great tuning. From there I went back and set the resonant sides of each of my four toms one notch higher than the batter side and marveled at the perfect tuning I attained.This is an easy device to use - with the lever facing you move it to the left, loosen all of your lugs, then tighten each starting with one or two. When the lever clicks and moves to the right position you have reached the torque setting.  Test, increase a notch if necessary, and repeat until you get the sound you want. Set the resonant heads either one notch higher or lower to make sure the batter and resonant heads do not cancel each other (and to your desired sound), and you will have a perfectly tuned set.I'll never go back to tuning by ear!  You'll be amazed by the results if you tune with this key, and don't forget to write down your optimum settings.","summary":"This actually works - and works well","unixReviewTime":1101686400,"reviewTime":"11 29, 2004"}

Less contact means less friction, less friction means greater tuning stability since your strings don't have as much chance to get caught up on anything when they move.I put them on a cheap Telecaster copy I have and noticed the results immediately, and I did not replace either the tuners or the nut, those are still the cheap stock parts.If you have a whammy bar and you bend a lot, rollers might be a little better, but for five bucks this is an easy upgrade (anyone can change them, all you need is a screwdriver), it was a no brainer for my Telecaster.","summary":"Don't NEED rollers on most guitars...","unixReviewTime":1379030400,"reviewTime":"09 13, 2013"}

Well, these are far from the most well thought out instrument cables you will find. These are stiff, thick, and heavy. While that's good for most analog cables, these cables are so stiff and heavy that, for instance, a portable tuner or a small stomp box might easily be moved around just by having one end of this cable in there.With so many amps having plastic jacks these days, you have to wonder what kind of stress these cables might be putting your amp jacks and pickguard-mounted output jacks under if these cables can fling a tuner around just by being plugged into one. I mean, let's face it. You never know what will happen at a gig. Sometimes you're playing with a 12 foot cable when you should have a 18 foot cable. A cable shouldn't come out because of a gentle pull, but if it's between the cable falling out and it moving a bass head around or you tripping on it, you want the cable to fall out. If everything you have is heavy or Velcro'd to the ground, this isn't a problem, but it is for me. I feel like when you're playing with these cables, you're worried about stepping on the cable not because you want to pull it out, but because it's seriously like a trip wire out there.Lastly, these plugs are huge. That's not really a problem if you play a Strat or a Tele, but what about a P-Bass or a J-Bass where the plug comes out at a right angle from the body? This is going to stick out a lot, and to loop it around your strap, it's going to be a huge, stiff, cumbersome loop. I know people often buy 90 degree plugs for those kinds of instruments, but most normal straight plugs do just fine. So yeah, if you like to move around on stage, get more flexible cables. You'll thank me.These cables are just poorly thought out. They'd work great as patch cords, or keyboards, drum machines, from pedal board to amp (as long as you have a metal jack). Monster has a cable that costs half as much but works twice as well for actual instrument use, and at that price, Pro Co cables are also excellent, and they have brand name plugs, as well.","summary":"Poor cables for active guitar players.","unixReviewTime":1346025600,"reviewTime":"08 27, 2012"}

So if you're like me andlike to let go a bit when you sing, you should try a Dynamic Mic for the wide range and forgiveness they can giveyou when you belt a little.I did an A / B test against the SM7B I just bought and the SM57 (I love) for vocals - with the exact same processing chain, cable, settings, etc. and just switched the mics out. I sung the same passage as well, and I have to say - the SM57 sounds muddy in comparison to the SM7B. If I didn't have this new microphone I would still like the SM57, but the Genni is out of the bottle now... so not going back. The SM7B is clear and sounds sweet in comparison and still handles the vocal sound dynamics very well.DYNAMIC SINGERS ( Rock, Jazz, GOSPEL, OPERA )= If you have the budget get this SM7B and if you don't, buy the SM57 until you do have the budget.QUIET SINGERS (ACOUSTIC , FOLK ) = If you sing softly all of the time you really don't need one of these dynamic mics, and would be better off with the standard Large Condenser mics as listed above.

{"reviewerID":"A1QDSJZQWJZOL1","asin":"B0002E4Z8M","reviewerName":"T. Cox","helpful":"[38, 38]","reviewText":"What you need to know about this mic:1) This mic is very directional. You must keep your mouth in the sweet spot at all times for best results. Pulling back an inch gets into tinny muddy territory, and an inch too close makes for a strong proximity effect. I found that a palm's width from the tip of the mic works best. As long as I keep my mouth there, the results are predictable and good regardless of the room I'm in. Also if the mic is aimed too low on your face (like at the lower lip or chin) you'll sound like you have a stuffy nose. Aimed too high (like at the bridge of the nose) sounds sneering and nasal. Right at the upper lip works well for me.2) The bass cut and presence boost are convenient. Use a plastic thing like a guitar pick to switch them, as metal will scratch it. I've played around with the switches and in the end both set to flat was best. Initially I thought the presence boost was a good idea, but in a mix it made my vocals too honky in the upper mids. Flat's where it's at. Flat sounds most natural.3) Being a dynamic, it won't sound as open and airy as a condenser might. Though it takes EQ well, and you can EQ that in. If you remove the foam and use a pop filter, you do get more highs, but after working with that for a while I realized it doesn't always sound right, seems to unbalance the highs above 5k toward sibilance a little too much, but it might work for you. After using it for a few years, I learned that starting with a bad mix that is too bright or blaring and then adding in the SM7B on vocals causes the mic to appear dull and muffled, but really it's the mix that's the problem. Whereas if I start with the vocal sound and make it clear and natural, and build the mix around it, the mix turns out to have a natural sound that's not too bright or dull either.4) Yes, it rejects room sounds more than a condenser, but not gobsmacked amazingly so. It rejects what's behind and to the side, but in front it's pretty sensitive. So if you're singing with an echoey room behind you, it will pick that up. So don't think this will make you sound like you're in a dead control room, unless you actually are in one. Hang some blankets or acoustic foam behind you and you're set. Being that it records about twice as dry as a condenser, it takes reverb pretty well in a mix, meaning you can add reverb and delay without having your vocals drop too far away and undefined in the mix.5) So what does it sound like? The sound is *very* natural and true to my voice. It truly is a vocal mic first and foremost. That plus the dry/up-close characteristic are this mic's top selling points. It works fantastically on death metal growls and clean singing atop sparse/acoustic/clean backgrounds. It does have slight color in the mids; I agree with the frequency response chart indicating it has a slight scoop 400-900Hz, slight boost 1000-2000Hz, but it's still natural sounding despite that. The color is tailored to the voice: reduce the honky boxy mids, accentuate the main vocal intelligibility range. That's one reason why this mic is considered \"flattering\" on vocals. It still has body though, definitely not a thin sounding mic.6) This thing is heavy and rugged. The capsule is surrounded by this truncated cone-like metal screen enclosed on all sides. The screen is like the kind you see behind microwave oven doors. What I like about this mic is that I can throw it inside a bubble mailer or wrap it in a scarf for storage and not have to worry about crushing or damaging it, and it doesn't need a big case like some condensers and especially tube mics do. So it's actually compact in practice and quick to set up with one of those detachable mic adapter mounts. Even without the adapter, it has a convenient free rotating collar to screw it onto a mount/stand so that you can hold the mic in place while screwing it down.7) This mic needs 50 dB gain for loud singing, 55-60dB for quiet singing, 65-70dB for whispering. Make sure your preamp is designed for at least 60dB of clean gain. Some cheaper USB interfaces only go up to 35dB. If your interface lacks the juice, no worries, get yourself a CloudLifter and it'll add 25dB of nice clean gain and it's phantom powered too.Overall, I would prefer a condenser in a good room since it allows me to move a little more without coloring the sound, and because it has a more openness and air compared to this one. But since my room isn't perfect, this will do. The biggest pros are that it's natural sounding and that even with reverb and delay it stands out in a mix. It's especially good on spoken voice, as it was designed for, since unlike a condenser the SM7B does a very good job of not picking up as many mouth clicks, mouth noises, and background hissing.In the end, if I had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life, it would be the SM7B. Mainly because I know I can conveniently use it anywhere, anytime, and get reliable good results.EDIT 2014:  Forgot to say, when you listen to mic shoot-outs on the net, often times the tip of the SM7B will be positioned the same distance as the condenser. This is a problem because the SM7B's diaphragm is actually back a few inches. So the condensers will be closer to the talent (or lack of talent) than the SM7B in such cases, causing the latter to sound more duck-ish, honky, un-detailed, or thin due solely to distance factors, and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color. In shoot-outs where the proper distance was used, you'd be surprised how much the SM7B sounds like a good condenser. It really does. Of course it may be missing air (or conversely, be less prone to sibilance) but as I said below you can *easily* EQ that in, since this mic takes EQ very well. Seriously, a 2dB shelf in the highs. Another thing I wanted to add, is that the gentle bump in the 1k to 2k region (for vocal definition) that his mic has, can sound slightly honky or strident or blaring depending on some sources, but again you can EQ that down a bit. And finally, when Shure says this mic has a flat response, that's not true, it has color and the frequency response charts show it. Yet, the color gives it a larger than life natural sound on voice, so it sounds natural even though it's not completely transparent and honest.","summary":"Natural sounding, but positioning is everything","unixReviewTime":1313020800,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2011"}

On the other hand, someone who takes care of their gear is probably not going to leave their instrument in a hot car (or garage or other storage space) for prolonged periods. However, you should be aware of the issue, if for no other reason than to remind you that if they case suffers, imagine the effect on your bass.The limitations are simple: the case, while a hard shell design, is not as strong as one made from ABS plastic.

When you tune one string your fingers can rub against next tuner.","summary":"Very nice Instrument! I can recommend it.","unixReviewTime":1387756800,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2013"}

There are variants for other instruments, but a relatively wide range will be held securely by this unit. The yoke width is adjustable, and a combination of slope and two keeper rings prevent the instrument from coming off the holder.Recommended...but do consider you means of mounting carefully.","summary":"Quality guitar hangers for display, rehearsal room, etc.","unixReviewTime":1359590400,"reviewTime":"01 31, 2013"}

I was shocked to see the high E and B strings were already flattened.  I never would have expected wear after just a few hours of light playing.The strings sounded great, but by the time I had them stretched enough that they would hold tune, they were already worn.I guess I'm going to HAVE to go to heavier strings so I'm not changing strings every few days.  These just did not perform as expected.Giving these 3 stars is being generous.  I have 5 sets to use up now, damn.

With stretching, they stay in tune fine. The unknown truth about non-nylon strings (and maybe even them, too) is that there are only a handful of string makers, and D'Addario actually makes them for other companies (Gore uses them for their Elixir series, and just adds the polyweb coating). I also use the GHS standard .010 sets, and they are good too. My faves are the Ernie Ball sets, but they rarely go on sale. I don't remember who makes what strings for what companies, though. With offshore production a standard thing now, it's no telling where they actually come from anyways.

You can mix brands and types, but how many picks can fit inside, will vary from around three, to perhaps a dozen.  As a guide, about 10 Dunlop 0.60mm nylon picks will fit, but only 4 Dunlop 1.50mm Delrin picks.  Even thick irregular picks like the Dunlop 3.0 Big Stubby will fit, however the total number will be greatly reduced.Build quality is good, but forcing too many picks inside, could cause the spring to fail, or the seam to split.  A piece of double stick tape, shaped to match the pick holder, is included.  The tape does a barely passable job of hold the device in place.  I stuck mine on the backside of the headstock of my guitar, and while it stays in place, it's pretty wobbly.Color options at this time seem to be limited to black, but if you have DIY skills, you could paint it whatever color you like.  This is a decent buy, below the two dollar level.

Not all picks are made the same & some are far better than others.The Dava Master Control Pick (DMCP) is a very nice & useful pick. I've been enjoying it for heavy strumming (or as the metalheads call it, \"chuggin'\"). I like its thin center and the way it is overall contoured which makes holding it a delight to my forefinger & thumb.Another thing I really like about it is the metal tip which some folks may not enjoy as it does give a bit of a metallic tone when it touches the strings. This is especially true when you've just replaced your old guitar's strings for new ones. Depends on how you like it or not whether you like that metallic ting - I do for certain passages.The pick's construction seems to be fairly rigid & yet it has potential to do more than merely chug again on the low E & A strings. DMCP is definitely a plectrum that I will be using a lot of in the future and not just for hard core metal but also for subtle tones in jazz passages with the distortion off.Overall I give the DMCP 5 out of 5 stars for being what it claimed it was and for being something that I will find great utility for in years to come.","summary":"NICE Pick for Stringed Instruments","unixReviewTime":1337558400,"reviewTime":"05 21, 2012"}

I tried this untreated 'MicrofiberPolish Cloth' on my Gibson ES-339 because I had heard good things about it.We'll begin with some stats: the cloth is 11-3/4\" by 11-3/4\" and has an 1/8\" border stitched aroundthe edge. It feels very soft to the touch and it is made in Korea. There is a small warning on theback of the package that states: \"Not designed for cleaning electrical devices.\" You can also washthis untreated polish cloth in mild soap and water, rinse it out and hang it up to dry. Now to thereview.My guitar has an Ebony hard lacquer finish, meaning very glossy and shiny. I have been playing thisguitar for about a year now and it had a lot finger smudges on the body's front and back and BACKof the neck. I was able to get most of the minor finger smudges off. When going after the moreresistant multiple smudges the polish cloth would spread it around and left most of the problem onthe finish.What I discovered about this cloth, even with increased elbow grease, is that it has it's limitations.So, if your guitar is reasonably clean and the smudges are fairly new this cloth is dynamite and takesthem right out. If the body oils have been there for awhile, probably collecting dust, then you willneed some type of cleaning liquid to help you break up the old fuzzy oils on your instrument. Pleaseuse any liquid sparingly when applying it to the surface of your instrument. Do not put a liquid directlyonto the surface of your instrument. You should put the cleaning liquid onto the cleaning cloth firstthen apply it.I decided to use Dunlop's 'Dunlop Formula 65 Guitar Polish & Cleaner' to cut and clean up the tougheroily smudges. I used another soft cotton cloth and it cleaned up very nicely. Since then I have beenable to keep the guitar polished and clean using only the 'Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth'. It doesnot leave scratches or any marks when used without a liquid. I also did not have a problems with thecloth breaking down and leaving lint or pieces of cloth behind.You want to use a another cloth to clean your fretboard and not the same one you use for the finish.The fretboard gets a lot of oily dirt assigned to it through repeated play. I would be fearful that theadditional oils accumulated  on the fret board will get into the Microfiber cloth and transfer to the finishof the guitar.So like a lot of things in life there are limitations to everything. I gave this untreated microfiber cloth4 stars because it does a fine job keeping my guitar clean  and polished with minimal effort. My highexpectations, based upon the blurb, were that this cloth would clean up more ensconced oils and dirtbut it only smeared them around. It was more trouble than it was worth to use the microfiber cloth toclean up the smeared mess.Nonetheless, I like this cloth and recommend it for upkeep purposes and minor dirt or grime. I will bekeeping it in my guitar case just for this particular guitar finish and use each time I am done playing.","summary":"Very Good For Upkeep:  Planet Waves Microfiber Polish Cloth - > Photos &lt;-  [NOT Pre-Treated / Grey]","unixReviewTime":1384300800,"reviewTime":"11 13, 2013"}

It can't be \"true bypass\" as long as the signal travels through a potentiometer but they can use pots that are a virtual short when adjusted properly and with the pedal forward.Anyway, the difference between plugging my guitar directly into the amp and placing this pedal in the chain between the amp is immediately noticeable.  The tone becomes duller, the output drops.  I would expect that from an Asian knock-off, not from an A-list gear maker.  I might be over-stating Ernie Ball's reputation, though they make some fine guitars I gotta say, and I've used their strings for many years.If you plan to use this EB-6180 pedal with digital effects you should be fine.  This is because the digital device will take two measurements of pure resistance at either end of the rocker.  The signal processing takes place in the unit, not the pedal.  (Those units have their own tone problems but that's another review.)It does occur to me that any pedal with a buffer (NOT \"true bypass\" in other words) may fix this problem, which is more than likely related to impedance, like a tuner pedal, between the guitar and the volume pedal.  I will need to try that out, but it does not excuse Ernie Ball from their responsibility.  Major FAIL on their part.2 stars is generous because EB fails to honor the simple \"first do no harm\" principle. It harms your tone.  How dumb is that?  The pedal itself is very attractive, appears indestructible, though I have my doubts about their \"string\" mechanism over time.  The rocker feels smooth and the weight gives the pedal stability on the floor.I have no recommendations for a volume pedal.  Because of the feel, and esthetics, I do plan to keep this for the digital device use, but wish it was able to do what it promises, and fails so miserably, to deliver.","summary":"Tone and Volume sucker","unixReviewTime":1361750400,"reviewTime":"02 25, 2013"}

It has 25 watts of power, a 10 inch speaker, a real spring reverb, and it's a traditional analog circuit without a digital processor.  It will make your electric guitar sound pretty much the way it's supposed to.The downside is that when I compare this amp to what Fender was selling fifteen years ago, the Champion 110, it falls a little short.  The particle board cabinet is thinner, the speaker is less hefty, and the whole thing feels and sounds a little less substantial.  It's obvious that the bean counters really pushed to get this thing as inexpensive as it is, and they also moved production to Indonesia from Mexico.  Maybe weight is a factor in shipping it across the ocean.All the same, I can still recommend it because it beats the crap out of digital amps and it gives you substantial power and a 10\" speaker and real Fender tone and looks.  Fender probably figures that players flush with cash will prefer a well-made tube amp or an amp with tons of digital modeling, but I kind of wish they still produced a solid 25 watt analog practice/light gigging amp.","summary":"Good value analog 10\" speaker amp","unixReviewTime":1292976000,"reviewTime":"12 22, 2010"}

The Samson SP01 shock-mount works perfectly with this stand ( as any shock-mount or mic would, since the threading is a standard size). I just wanted to clear that up so that there would not be any confusion. Also almost every shock-mount has an adapter in the mount ( where the shock-mount connects to the mic stand) that is slightly smaller than most US mic stands, BUT THIS COMES OUT!!

It makes my tube halfstack sing, and my practice amp sound like a big amp.Its great as a stand alone distortion, running on a clean amp.  It can get everything from that perfect bluesy grit to roaring sludge (just max out the distortion and use your neck pickup on an LP to sound EXACTLY like King Buzzo of the Melvins) and everything inbetween.It can also be used to boost an overdriven amp into better sounding territory.  Case in point, my buddy has an old Peavy stack from the 70's in his garage.  Its a solid state head on top of a vertical cab of two 14\" speakers.  On its own, you can use the gain and distortion knobs present on the amp to get a decent sound, but with his Les Paul it still sounded oddly dark.  We put the Rat in front of it and with some fiddling got that perfect AC/DC style overdrive out of it.I think the main reason I love the Rat so much is not only the great tone and its sheer indestructability, but the filter knob.  Normal tone knobs allow you to focus more on bass or treble, but usually if you boost one, you cut the other.  The filter is more of a high end roll off, you can darken or brighten your tone accordingly, but when you DO go brighter, you still have the same bottom end.  It doesn't CUT the bass out.  So even with a more treble heavy sound, you still have a fuller rounder tone, it doesn't thin out so much.Its really an excellent pedal.  I've heard that some claim you have to get an older one with the LM308 chip to really get \"the sound\" but that's a myth.  Look on a few guitar forums or on youtube for plenty of tests and testimony showing the fact that the new ones do indeed sound the same as the old ones.  A Rat is a Rat, whether they're coming from China or the USA.p.s.  Mine is from 2010 and the face still glows in the dark.

The solution is perfect, but the applicator (attached to the neck of the bottle) could be better.

It does some compression, overdrive, EQ'ing, notch EQ'ing, and excite-ing all in one pedal. So compared to the original bass signal, you get this clear, deep, punchy sound that fits right into a mix.The Bass Attack sounds a lot like a SansAmp Bass Driver but at 1/3 the price. One difference is that it has an additional \"Shape\" knob, which is a lot like the ISF knob on Blackstar products, and is a notch filter. The other difference is that the SansAmp uses tougher chassis and components, so would last longer for the gigging musician. But don't take me wrong, the Bass Attack uses a solid metal chassis and doesn't feel cheap at all.The Harmonics knob adds some overdrive, and gets kind of farty when turned up 100% but sounds pretty good at 75-90%. It doesn't do that high gain super gritty/fizzy distortion though, for that you could connect a distortion pedal to the parallel output, or duplicate the track in your DAW and add a distortion plugin.This pedal is very versatile. I found that the Shape knob is indispensable; it takes the place of a mid control. For example, by notching (reducing) the boomy 60-130 Hz region and turning up the level, you get plenty more mids. The treble and bright control seem very similar to each other, one seems to amplify the 4k region, the other the 5k but that's just an estimate. By keeping both of those around 10 o'clock and the Shape control beneath 115 Hz, I can get a solid, deep, yet mid-full sound for a metal mix. Thus anyone who thinks this pedal is all bass and treble and no mids, ought to try settings along those lines.Another good feature is that this pedal can run on 48V phantom power. As in, no adapter or battery needed when recording direct or running to a mixer. In conclusion, for recording, you can duplicate the SansAmp sound that you hear on a lot of albums using the Bass Attack, and tweak it further via the Shape control. And yes, the various button pushes get you four different sounds total, but I prefer having both buttons on. Then in my DAW I only throw on an extra compressor and it sounds great. This pedal is a steal for no frills bass DI recording.","summary":"Awesome","unixReviewTime":1321488000,"reviewTime":"11 17, 2011"}

The real problem began when I switched to different strings- silk and steels. I  LOVED the tone I was now getting, but the intonation problems were suddenly much worse.What I had not considered, until my friend mentioned it, is that while my new strings provide the tonal warmth I was looking for, they are also easier to \"bend out of tune\". (Duh, I should have thought about this, it makes perfect sense in retrospect!) The capo I had been using was putting WAY too much pressure on the strings, and  greatly exacerbated the existing issue... one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired.So he mentioned this capo, and I immediately chortled.

A couple of warnings here, which have nothing to do with the quality of the straplocks: 1.) you need to make sure the screw is snug in the hole; some people put a matchstick, toothpick, piece of paper or SOMETHING inside the hole to tighten it up if the hole's too big or has been stripped out; I use a touch of Elmer's Glue, screw in the straplock, and let it sit for a day.  2.) You have to make sure the ends that fasten to your strap are securing enough of the strap so that it doesn't work itself off the end; use a socket to get the nut really tight.

However, I had problems at first until I made some changes.- First off, you need to put a drop of lock tight on the threads or the nut will loosen. The blue stuff will be more than enough.- Second, the lock can grab the strap pin on your guitar and turn/loosen the screw over time. Kinda defeats the purpose of the locks if they hold on to the button but the button comes out of your guitar. So... When I install the new button, I put a drop of epoxy in the screw hole first. Never had one unscrew again.If you do those things first, you will never have your guitar strap fall off by accident. Ever...

I'm loyal to the audio community and the industry has already put one of my kids through college.I see half of this stand as being just fine but the boom is not very good. I particularly don't think the horizontal axis point is very good, I mean where you adjust the angle of the boom. It's a cheap version of a simple design and I suspect the day will come that you're trying to figure how to keep it from drooping, the problem being that the surface area is much smaller creating less friction and more tightening until something's got to give. The tightening screws to slide it also seem pretty poor and I'd predict someday you'll be going from duct tape to replacing it. I base this more on my experience in sound reinforcement, which is harder on equipment than recording and because I own both types of businesses. The boom in general isn't a nice one and will always be 32 inches because it isn't telescoping and uses a pretend plastic counterweight, so you're mainly purchasing the stand. On Stage has a better line they call the 9700 vs this 7700 series.9701B Pro Tripod Microphone Boom StandJust like you can't compare the price of a used compact car with a new full size pickup, this one is so inexpensive (too inexpensive?) that price comparisons aren't what's important, so looking at Amazon today I'd probably buy the 9700MS9701TB TeleBoom Microphone Standor this one,DR Pro Mic Stand Telescoping Boomor maybe try this oneHosa MSB-521BK Mic Stand with BoomI haven't tried that stand but since Hosa generally sells good inexpensive products I'd be inclined to give it a try. I think you'll end up spending more money on your next stand and you might as well do it once instead of twice. I'd pay attention to the 2 and 3 star reviews because you'll find more from experienced users and the most helpful 5 star do not say how long they've been using it but love how inexpensive it is. Ignore that it doesn't come with a mic clip because usually they don't, clips come with microphones or can be purchased separately. All but the best stands will fall over when unbalanced, so plan on putting weight on a leg if you're using a heavy mic like a condenser or spending a lot more money. $100+ will buy you a studio boom although a counterweight, like what's used on a cymbal boom will help any boom stand and could be created with a little imagination. As for the cheap cord clips, just forget them and buy these, they'll attach to a stand or cord and work excellent (no leftover duct tape glue).Velcro Reusable Self-Gripping TiesBut understand my position, I've got stands purchased 20 years ago that I can still use and don't feel the lowest price is always the best value, but you're intelligent so you know an $80 stand used for 20 years is $4/year, I use stands almost everyday and I don't think this would last me a year and maybe only months. But if1. You don't care about a telescoping boom and2. You don't plan to adjust it much and3. You use a average weight mic or4. You're alright with replacing the boom when neededThis stand could be fine for you now if you can't budget a higher quality stand and it will surely work for some.

I'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone. This definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal. To the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone. Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing.The lo contour knob doesn't \"increase\" the amount of bass produced by the amp. Rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone. To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't. You're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp.The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies. These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh.That's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better.Now, I gave this product 4 stars not because I've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect. At first I almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off. With time I've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a \"night and day\" difference.I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better. This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack. It won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before.In conclusion, though I definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the \"must have\" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone. This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones.","summary":"I'd call it more of a \"tone maximizer\"","unixReviewTime":1286150400,"reviewTime":"10 4, 2010"}

First, let's not expect $500 double 16&#34; sound from a portable 9v amp.  Once that reality is recognized, it's realized this puts out far better sound than one would ever expect from an amp this size and price.I would note that the sound you get out of this amp-- as with any amp-- will be directly relational to the quality of guitar and pickup you're feeding from.  I tried this on three different guitars and each one sounded significantly different.  One had very rich tone, another sounded &#34;tinny&#34;, another had a passive pickup and required I turn the HoneyTune up quite a bit more than the one with active pickup.  So it won't sound the same on every guitar.That said, if your guitar has good tone and your pickup is good, this amp is simply awesome.  I've had it only one day so I haven't put it through the test of time... but first-impressions are that I will buy more of these in the future (I need more than one portable amp).My sister visited and heard it right after I opened the box, and she was impressed as well.  Neither of us expected this kind of sound from such a small amp.  And I have to say, the aqua color is major retro.  Gotta luv it.I've been looking for &#34;the&#34; portable amp for some time.

I think I may have blown the speaker or it's just how it sounds but it's great for a lo-fi kind of fuzz-e tone when the gain and levels are all the way up.

I have to concede I'm a bit spoiled by the super light weight and much more compact folded dimensions of myK & M Memphis Pro Guitar Stand. However that light weight comes at the cost of a slightly more fragile build. The extra heft of the Hercules has the advantage of slightly better stability when you remove the instrument from the stand (the K&M; tends to want to bounce backward as the weight is removed if used on a padded carpeted floor). Despite not folding up quite as small, the Hercules is simpler to unfold and adjust (one action for legs, one action for height, whereas the K&M; has three separate legs and two vertical sections / clamps). I do realize that I bought the one without the folding yoke and am not considering that aspect when comparing it to the K&M.; Length and girth folded would still be quite a bit larger than the K&M; (large enough that I won't try carrying it in my gig bag pocket as I do the K&M;).I'm also not convinced Hercules' trade mark pivoting finger yoke is all that necessary on this type of stand. The back angle and the fact that a good portion of the instrument rests against the padded legs means it would take so much force to knock an instrument off of it that it's knock the whole stand over. No big deal, just more parts (and weight). I think I prefer K&M;'s yoke, as it automatically adjusts inward to the width of the neck as weight is applied. The Hercules has a fixed width yoke with pivoting \"gates\". Both work perfectly well with my Fender and similar bass head stocks.I've had two of the K&M;'s and the second was a bit of a disaster. It was defective in more than two areas. Defects happen, but one highlighted a weakness which concerns me a bit, and lead me to try the Hercules(I won't go into all of that here, see my review on that product). Aside from the potential weak spot of the yoke, the Hercules should prove to be far more durable and tolerant of my occasional clumsiness. I'm glad I purchased this one and I think I'll get plenty of use from it. But I should mention, it did allow me to better understand and appreciate the strengths of the K&M;, mainly its awesome portability (despite its slightly more fragile nature).In the interest of further comparison, I've got anUltimate  GS100 Support Genesis 100 Guitar Standon order, and will review it against this and the K&M; as well. I opted for the GS-100 without an automatic closing mechanism over the GS-1000 which has one for the reasons I stated above- I don't believe it is strictly necessary. The reviews of the GS100 are also more favorable, and the GS100 is cheaper (which suits my cheapness.","summary":"Stable, sturdy, easy to use","unixReviewTime":1367366400,"reviewTime":"05 1, 2013"}

This condenser mic is way larger and heavier than a dynamic mic, I was surprised when I took it out of the box.  It is as good looking in person as in the pictures.  Three things for the benefit of other newbs: 1.) I learned that condenser mics are very susceptible to moisture and so you have to purchase a windscreen if you're going to use this for vocals, since moisture from singing into the mic can damage it. 2.) This has a cardioid pickup pattern; you don't sing directly into the end of the mic like a dynamic mic.  This should stand straight up on a mic stand, paying attention to which way the mic is facing since it there will be a lot of attenuation on one side of it. 3.) It requires phantom power.  You need a PA that provides 48V power to use it.When I first used this mic, I tried singing into the end of it and couldn't hear myself very well.  Later in the evening I was standing off to the side and could hear myself so loud that I had to back away about a foot from the mic.  Then I remembered reading about the cardioid pattern and stood it up straight on the mic stand, paying attention to the orientation of the mic.  It was so sensitive that I really had to stay backed up from the mic and it was easy for two or three people to stand around it for vocals.  I have a Rainsong WS1100 acoustic electric guitar I was playing, and was able to turn off my amp completely because this mic picked up the instrument and my vocals so clearly.  Other musicians were impressed by it as well.

It boosts the guitars signal. It does it really well, with very little to no noise. The thing I like most is that it is not a \"sledge hammer\" type pedal or overdrive. The input signal is cleanly boosted. What you put into the input comes out the same only louder. It starts with no change in the signal and allows you to raise up the gain very slowly. It just gives the signal from your guitar a stronger output to whatever you are plugging into (amp, mixer, effects or pedal board). This pedal arrived at my door on a Friday afternoon so I took it to a gig that night without trying it first (something I don't normally do). The first two times I used this pedal were that night (Friday) and the next (Saturday). I thought it worked great for my needs. A few days later I read a review that said this pedal had a noticable hiss. Since I didn't remember hearing any, I got it out at home and plugged it into my amp (I have the same amp at home that I use live). When you activate it with the tone set flat on the pedal and the volume about 12:00, there is a very sight hiss (no noise when bypassed). For me it is a very minor hiss that in live situations with all the normal room noises I never heard at all. This may not be true for all amps and maybe some high gain input amps may handle this signal differently. I know for sure it is a lot quieter than almost any effects pedal I have ever owned and I have box full from 35 years of playing. I am using a Vox VT30 which is a modeling amp with lots of bulit in effects (delays, chorus, flanger, compressors etc.) These days I don't use any additional outboard effects (except a BBA Sonic Stomp that I never turn off) so siganl from my guitar hits my amps input very cleanly. If you use various guitars on gigs, this pedal is very useful. It allows me to quickly match the various guitar output levels and compensate for differences between humbuckers, single coils and piezo pick ups on an acoustic without having to adjust the amp controls. This is a great problem solver for any rig that needs to control the input level to the amp and it does it at a bare bones price.I have owned several Behringer pedals for live work and have some Behringer rack gear in my live audio rack and in my home studio. I gig reguarly once to twice a week faithfully. I have never broken or had a problem with any of my Behrinnger gear (including a pair of Behringer 12\" powered speakers mixed with a pair of Mackie 15\" powered mains). I don't intentionally abuse my gear but at 2:00 when your packing up s*** happens but so far my Behringer stuff has never let me down yet and I have had some it for many years. I also keep reading about people worrying about the hard plastic cases on Behringer pedals. Don't worry about it. They are sturdy enough. (Just watch out if you are changing the battery on a dark stage. The battery goes under the pedal switch and the spring that is under the foot switch will probbaly fall out if you are not careful. (To open the battery compartment/foot switch cover just use a pen or small phillips style jewelers screwdriver and push in the black pins on either side of the pedal.)","summary":"Does just what I want and does it well.","unixReviewTime":1375660800,"reviewTime":"08 5, 2013"}

Long story short I was trying to get a podcast going from scratch about three months ago.  I did some research and discovered that a shockmount is necessary to keep any noise from anything securing the mic from being picked up by the mic while recording.  A shockmount is an absolute must, especially when looking at using a tabletop mic stand where the table will also be used as a work surface.The build quality is fantastic.  I just recently purchased my THIRD shockmount for an additional mic to be used on the podcast.What I've grown to appreciate so much is that it seems to fit just about any condenser microphone I can get my hands on.  If you are considering buying this for your own condenser mic, make absolutely sure that your mic has threads on the bottom to be screwed into some type of stand or shockmount.  Nearly all do, but some companies like Blue (Snowball, snowflake, etc.) are designed not to be used in conjunction with shock mounts. I have used the MXL 007.USB with this shockmount as well as the AT2020 USB and XLR version.  The MXL fit like a glove, perfect.  The AT2020, once threaded in, seemed just a bit loose, so I added a couple foam bumpers around the base to act as a washer.  It made a tight fit and further insulated it from any sound interference from any movement.In short, I haven't found a better shockmount for condenser mics.  The attachment screws onto any desktop tripod and traditional mic stand.  Fantastic.

Upfront, the pedal sounds great. In the store, if you demo this pedal, you'll quickly be able to zero in on whatever distortion you prefer... but over time, you'll get very frustrated with the actual tone of the distortion itself. Turn any of the knobs past 12, and you'll get some undesirable nasal/hissy/tinny frequencies that require compression, noise gating, and EQ to tame. The &#34;Top Boost&#34; does provide what it advertises, but if the pedal itself is already Dimebagged and you engage the Top Boost... it just sounds weird and unmusical.Electro Harmonix is a great pedal manufacturer, but I think they overstepped their bounds with this one. Where is this pedal now in my collection? Sold for cash. After deciding to bite the silver bullet and purchase a BOSS ME-70 Multi-Effects to simplify my gigging setup, I figured as nice as it is to have an Analog Distortion like the Metal Muff, it would never compete with the Digital Distortion onboard the ME-70... boy was I wrong. After getting the ME-70, I did an A/B test and the ME-70 took home the gold easily. This came at no surprise... considering both BOSS and MXR are respected manufacturers when it comes to Distortion sounds.What would I recommend you purchase? That depends. If you're in a metal band, and you're recording an EP, no pedal in my opinion comes close to fully-cranked tube-amp distortion. However, if your amp doesn't have a good distortion channel or capability, then a more conservative (and affordable) BOSS DS-1 for a more musical metal tone. The reality is, most manufacturers have great distortion pedals, so it really depends on your subjective standards for tone... since no two distortions sound the same. Personally, I recommend the MXR Fullbore Metal... the pedal I wish I had bought instead of the Metal Muff. The Noise Gate and Mid Scooper switches are far better pedal accessories than a Top Boost. The Fullbore also has a Mid Frequency shaping knob... which can dramatically shape the overall sound.","summary":"Metal Muffler","unixReviewTime":1388102400,"reviewTime":"12 27, 2013"}

I don't use the EBow very often but when I do, it really adds to the performance. I recorded an EBow track for an original song in a passage where there was only acoustic guitar and it added another dimension to the overall sound and made my recording sound more professional. For live playing it can be a little tricky because sometimes it takes a few seconds to get the strings to start vibrating. With practice, I think this could improve. I play the solo on STP's &#34;Sour Girl&#34; and it sounds very much like the original recording. People in the audience tend to take notice during that solo and I get questions about how it works. I have not had good luck with arpeggios but again, practice could improve this.The octave switch is great for a controlled feedback sound. Battery life is exceptional.

I am the only guitarist and in my playing environment (children's church) and frequently need to switch back and forth between acoustic and electric. The AC3 does that job. Although it has several modes, the Jumbo mode seems to be most useful. Played through a carefully EQ'd amp, you can get a tone comparable to a plugged in acoustic electric with very bright settings. There is an audible hiss, less noticeable plugged direct into PA, noticeable plugged into a good, clean tube amp, out of control with humbuckers or solid states.The key to using this pedal is using it correctly.First and foremost: use single coils. Tested with a Les Paul with Burstbucker Pro's, the hiss was overwhelming. Played with an American Deluxe Strat with N3 Noiseless pups in the 3rd position, it actually performed very well on a crystal clean channel.Point two - any form of gain will create a ton of hiss.Point three - tube amps perform infinitely better than solid state amps (tested through a Frontman 212 and Vox Pathfinder vs an Orange Tiny Terror and Fender HRD).The AC3 is not a set it and forget it pedal. Based on the volume of the amp and the room you're in, you will need to tweek the EQ to find that tone. I've read that you can use an EQ pedal to get the same tones, I haven't found that to be the case. If your use for this pedal is to cover acoustic parts in a pinch, or in my case as the only guitar player, to switch from acoustic to electric parts quickly, this is a great fit.-2 stars for ever present  hiss, +3 for actually sounding like an acoustic when it's EQ'd correctly.","summary":"Serves it's purpose","unixReviewTime":1376179200,"reviewTime":"08 11, 2013"}

Not only do stands have to hold guitars securely, they shouldn't harm the finishes of the instrument. Unfortunately many stands will harm the nitrocellulose lacquer on many higher-end guitars; since I have two guitars of this nature, protecting them was of the utmost import to me. Fortunately these stands protect most nitrocellulose finishes, and I have never had problems with mine. The stands themselves (both varieties) fold up to be very compact if you need portability, and support the guitar very securely. I don't gig with these guitars, so portability was not paramount to me, but stability was: these stands are extremely stable and are very sturdy (mine reside on a carpeted floor, and I have never had any issues with them tipping over.) Some people may not love the yellow and black \"bumble bee\" coloration, but I actually find it whimsically industrial. I am completely happy with all three of my Hercules stands: they are safe, portable, rugged, and won't hurt the finish on most guitars.

The insulators are tough and do not easily nick when being dragged around on rough stages. However, it's the attention to small construction details that I love. The XLR ends are quality components, but cheap, ill fitting junk that some companies use to keep costs down. And unlike those cheap ones these will mate and disengage smoothly.Another factor is the strain reliefs at each end. Those keep the conductors from fraying or breaking inside the cable, which will often occur at cable ends on cables without them.Of course the color coding is a godsend. I can now tell at a glance what is connected to what, both live and in my home studio. I have not experienced any extraneous noise using these, but I am careful to eliminate sources or route around them. Still, these are as good as any other cables I have purchased.I'll also admit that price initially entered into my buying decision. I was frankly concerned that at the price point these would turn out to be junk. Not the case. I can happily say that sometimes you really do get more than you pay for.","summary":"Perfect for live or studio","unixReviewTime":1371686400,"reviewTime":"06 20, 2013"}

I considered a few different brands and even other Line 6 POD models. I even ordered a POD XT only to cancel that order when I realized that you can download tones from the Line 6 website and add them into the user memory banks for easy retrieval.As many have said, the batteries that come with it did not last long at all, but that was kind of expected. I have since been using Energizers and those are lasting long enough for my needs, plus I have a 9 volt AC adapter that works great, especially when I am recording.To use it for recording, simply output from the headphone jack to the input on your laptop or desktop computer and you'll be able to record with all the tones you could want! I downloaded a Joe Satriani sound and am so happy with it that I have already recorded myself playing one of his songs with it and it sounds great!I am not going to knock a star off for this since they obvously put a belt clip on it for a reason, but if you are like me and still like to sit it on a desk every now and then, it will not stay put by itself as it is not heavy enough, but I found that you can put two rubber bands on either side of it and it helps it to &#34;grip&#34; better and stay put so that it doesn't slide right off.I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to any guitarist out there who needs some great tones to practice with.

I was looking at some nicer ones, and decided to give it a go for only $20. It came in the mail today, and i was surprised that basic-ness of the packaging. Very little instructions at all actually.This DOES NOT ship with a 9 volt battery, and putting one in yourself is kind of a pain to change, as you have to get a philips screwdriver and unscrew 4 corner screws on the back to do so. (wish there was a plastic back, or thumb screw option)This pedal is really quiet, and not in a good way.Don't expect to boost your signal level with it, with the makeup gain/output knob all the way up and the sensitivity all the way down, it was about the same volume as the original signal, only a little noisier.Did not seem to be a tone sucker in the chain/add any noise when off. Most compressors add a little noise or hiss when on, due to the nature of raising the noise floor.It also has a SUBSTANTIAL treble boost/low cut going on. even with the sensitivity knob all the way down, it kills your low end. It is quite bright sounding.With that being said, it works wonders on single string/double stop stuff on the already trebley stuff played on the G, B, and E strings, and makes them sound tight and full.It does seem quite durable, The case isn't made of cheap plastic, which is a good thing.Though not as rugged as some of the other pedals I would own.The switch and inputs seem a little cheap though, granted it was a $20 pedal.I feel using this pedal on tour might be a bad idea, however for home/non daily-use i could see it lasting a while.The LED is really bright. Almost so bright, that when you're looking to adjust the controls, it makes it somewhat hard to see what you're doing.All in all, if you're looking for a cheap compressor to boost your  treble strings and give em some extra punch, this may be the pedal for you, especially if you only have $20.If you're looking for a warm full bodied compressor, this is not the choice for you.

I use this amp mainly in the Modern UK preamp setting for most of the music I play. When I tried it at the shop it sounded great. Of course, I couldn't go stage level in the shop, so I couldn't really get a feel for the sound.I took it to practice the next day and was really put off by the floppy sound of the low end when \"chugging\" on the low E. So I went about experimenting. First, I converted the combo amp to a closed back speaker cabinet instead of the original Vox open-back design. Small improvement, but not close enough.After couple of weeks, I also noticed some volume variations as I played. With a little research, I found that it is one of the signs of a bad tube. I did a little more research on the 12AX7 tubes and found that they are not all created equal (of course) and was looking for one with tighter low end. This one came up in the specs of doing just that. (I believe it was x[...] where I got that info)I got the tube this morning put some gloves on an went about switching out the tube. (YES. TREAT THESE LIKE HALOGEN BULBS. THE OIL FROM YOUR SKIN WILL CREATE HOTSPOTS AND DAMAGE THE TUBE QUICKLY) I pulled out a GT Groove tube from the amp. I was totally surprised! Groove Tubes were THE tubes to have in the late '80s. Now a days, I read they are rebranded Chinese tubes. So sad.Anyway, total tone improvement.

Less bright but still keeping all the chime in this amp. It caused just enough high end roll off to give the warmth I've been looking for (to my ears). I found the JJ12ax7 to be much clearer but slightly harsher in the high end-maybe more Fenderish? I REALLY like the way the Tungsol makes my Jazzmaster sound.  It's heaven!  It gives me the perfect breakup point and perfect roll off of highs.My findings could and probably will be different from yours because of your guitar, cable quality, pick attack and style of playing. My best advise is BUY MANY different brands and TRY THEM ALL in your amp. they're not that expensive if you go with the cheaper ones.

Guitar\"","helpful":"[10, 10]","reviewText":"COMPARISONS: I have compared, side by side, the following pedals:Fulltone mini deja vibe ($200), Dunlop Univibe (discontinued stainless steel model)($220), Dunlop Roto-vibe ($180), Voodoo Labs Micro Vibe ($150), BBE Soul Bender ($129) as well as comparing to some \"different beasts\" in the modulation family - an MXR phase 90, MXR EVH flanger, Boss chorus, Behringer Vibrato, and Behringer Time Machine.SUMMARY - just the factsA great pedal and my favorite uni-vibe of all. Doesn't take a lot of space up, standard power supply, good visibility on control knob settings. Does not add or subtract frequencies to the signal or add noise. This is the only pedal in the univibe group I can say that about and it's why it's almost certainly going to be the one I keep. Might have slightly less ability to produce as thick of a univibe effect as some of the others -- still need to play with it a little more. Overall I LOVE this pedal at under 60 bucks. Only downsides I see are the LED does not flash the speed rate, and the speed control is top left which makes it hard to \"toe tweak\" with my right foot. Quality seems ok, but time will tell on durability.PROS- Smallish form factor, although slightly larger than a \"boss\" pedal, doesn't take much more room than a standard pedal.- Standard power supply (9v Center negative), and jack on top back for easy access - not in the way for patch cables on sides.- Switchable between chorus(univibe) and vibrato.- Controls spaced well for handling and use knobs with high visibility marking - easy to see.- Best PRO is that it does not boost or cut volume and does not boost or cut bass, mids, or lows. It just applies the uni-vibe type effect as dialed in and retains the character of the guitar tone. This is the only pedal I tested that I can say that about -- and most of the others cost 2-4 times what this one cost.- LED is red, visible and NOT a weird bright laser to my retina- The PRICE at about 60 bucks - is a great deal- Quality of construction -- metal case, decent knobs, pots and switches - no complaints so far.CONS- LED does not flash speed rate- Speed control would be better placed Top right or bottom right for \"toe\" tweaking- I have just had this a day so can't tell but might be limited in getting the deepest most lush univibe sound - not sure about that and I will update this review as I get time to test further. But it sounds great to me...OVERALL - highly recommended if you want a univibe and don't want to do a lot of comparison shopping. I have done it for you. Some users report quality issues here -- I guess time will tell on that. Mine works fine so far, and for $60 you could buy 2 and still save money over most other options available.--------------------------------------NOTES ON ***OTHER*** PEDALS I COMPARED---------------------------------------- Fulltone Mini Deja vibe -- highest quality construction (as expected at $200). The large knob in the lower right corner for speed is great and allows toe tweaking -- very useful on a vibe pedal. My complaint is that this vibe colors my tone - it boosts the mid range tones while maintaining the crisp highs and slightly losing the bass. This probably helps the sound stand out in a mix, however, I'd rather that my vibe not provide EQ because when I switch it on or off, I don't want to have to compensate at my guitar tone knobs to try to get back \"my sound\". I was able to match exactly an authentic original Uni-vibe sound with some adjusting. It seems to kind of muffle the pick attack or compress it also. I have a love-hate relationship with this pedal after about a week of testing it. Some days I hate it...but I like the build quality and the speed control. I originally liked that it was one of only two pedals that didn't strip the treble off my tone -- until I realized the mids were boosted, the bass was cut and the pick attack was somehow tweaked. Mixed bag, and at $200 shouldn't be.- MXR/Dunlop M68 (new in 2014). At about $140, The new M68 Uni-Vibe is a very good vibe pedal with much to like. It is second place on my list. On pure sound I might even like it slightly better than the Jimi, and that's saying something! It's the perfect form factor (shape/size) with no significant coloration of the tone, other than perhaps a tiny boost of treble in one mode. The M68 gives the Jimi a good run...and if you are extremely tight on board space, it might be a better choice for you. They sound very similar. The M68 has a wider range of adjustment on speed/depth than the Jimi, but I'm not sure the extra range is useful. MXR/Jim Dunlop/MXR have GREAT factory customer service if you ever have an issue. They fixed one of my pedals free even though out of warranty. I really do wish MXR would move their power supply jack to the rear vertical surface instead of the right side vertical surface. It is often in the way of right angle plugs on all my other MXR's. Use of the small top left push button for switching from chorus to vibe on this pedal was the main negative issue as I'd have to leave it with the mini switch engaged, and the red LED burning all the time, looking like it is on when I was not actually engaging the circuit with the main switch. It was also a tight fit. This pedal has a level knob which I'm usually a fan of but I don't see the need for it on this effect. I didn't care for the white \"main\" LED much, and of course the power supply location. The LED on this does pulse the speed, but was annoying due to the white LED. That's a subjective thing I suppose. All said this is a great sounding option with that perfect MXR size, so a good choice. But still 2X the cost of the Jimi. I stuck with the Jimi on form, function, sound, and value.- Dunlop Uni-vibe UV1 -- Cool stainless steel construction. Knobs were hard to see settings. placement of vintage switch on the back of the pedal was easily forgotten at worst and awkward at best. Non standard 18V power supply takes double slots from my power supply brick. Sound was very good but did also color my EQ sound by boosting the bass, and muffling the mids and highs slightly. On the one hand, this sound matched a lot of recorded uni-vibe sounds I've heard. On the other hand, once you strip the treble its hard to put it back in the mix. The seller had a 3 day return policy (3 days??!!) so I returned it and they lost the sale. Othewise, I would still be thinking about this one. I was on the fence about whether it was my winner. I was able to match a true uni-vibe sample, but the treble was slightly lacking and bugged me. At $220 I'd have to love it to keep it.- Voodoo Labs Micro Vibe - Liked the form factor, the simple controls, high visibility knobs, ability to toe tweak controls, standard 9V power supply, and placement of all jacks. Can get a very lush, even excessive univibe sound except the bass is very boosted, and mids/highs are cut. The EQ effect just kills the pedal for me. Its going back. Not my pick at $150.- BBE Soul Bender - My least favorite Vibe. It had extreme muffling of mids and highs, heavy boost of bass. In a band mix, I'm pretty sure it would get totally lost. At home, might sound ok. form factor was good, controls were simple, I think it pulsed the speed. My recollection is it had an overly bright blue LED. It was the first vibe I bought, and I only compared to Fulltone and Dunlop before returning it. Had some useable sounds, but with the intensity above 50% had an annoying \"womp womp womp\" of a bass note that was not coming from my guitar -- a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion. With intensity below 50% it was usable...kind of. But a tone muffler. I returned this one early.- Dunlop ROTO-Vibe : A good choice (perhaps the only choice) if you MUST have expression pedal controlled speed adjustment. Didn't color the tone much - and that was a problem on most other uni-vibes tested. Limited speed range and awkward controls placement were most annoying to me. Intensity range seemed less than other pedals too. Large footprint if mounted on board, but also offers the ability to take NO space on the board by not mounting it. I didn't like that when you switch the effect on, you are automatically at high speed due to the mechanical nature of the design. Some awkwardness in the placement of controls and power plug vs guitar cables when plugged in. Std power supply a plus. LED indicators good and flash the speed. Durable construction although the mechanical nature means in time something will need lubricating and you may need to replace internal gears or pots. Overpriced 1.5 to 2X in my opinion.- Other general modulation effects. Univibes are effectively a phase effect - without the swooshy space-age edge on the sound. You can probably modify a modern phaser pedal to get the univibe sound which is like a vibrato plus analog chorus combined. A modern phaser is close, a modern flanger is much too space-age sounding. Vibrato pedals can capture the vibrato aspect of a uni-vibe and I'd recommend the behringer vibrato at $25 if you like vibrato sounds. uni-vibes are normally used for their \"chorus\" setting, not the vibrato setting. Didn't care for the Behringer time machine.My gear used for testing: Fender American Deluxe stratocaster. Mesa Mini-rectifier amplifier, Mesa Rectifier 2x12 cabinet with Celestion V30's. Pedal train pedal board, voodoo labs pedal power power supplies.A NOTE ON VENDOR SELECTIONI had a very bad experience with the vendor I bought my MXR/Dunlop M68 from, and while it does not weigh at all on my review of that product, I provided a separate star rating on the vendor feedback page. I recommend if you choose to purchase that pedal (or anything else) you be careful to avoid the Amazon Marketplace vendor called MixDSPnet in San Jose, CA. In addition to charging a 15% restocking fee if you want to return the pedal (in original condition with all materials and packaging), getting them to even acknowledge the return request at all was a problem and took over a week and finally opening a claim with Amazon to get any meaningful response. Once they did communicate, they were very unprofessional. Further, when the product was shipped back signature required (as recommended by amazon), they were \"not available\" or refused to sign for it so after several weeks of attempting to return the product, it remains **unrefunded** despite their confirmation that I could return the item for an 85% refund. I expect I'll need to work further with Amazon in the end to get this resolved. A google earth view of their addressed explained it all. MixDSPnet appears to be running out of an apartment complex. Most Amazon marketplace sellers are just fine but this one is really not, at least when it comes to returns. Also, while they sell a few Dunlop/MXR guitar pedals, looking at their site reveals it's not their primary business - they seem to sell a bunch of other non-musical widgets. My recommendation is that you find a vendor who is in the musical instrument business and who will provide the typical no cost refunds for 30 to 45 days as most large musical instrument retailers do, should you need it. They have a few hundred positive transactions, so maybe can be OK but I can only comment on my experience and this was the worst online transaction I've ever had shopping on amazon.","summary":"a GREAT choice for a univibe pedal","unixReviewTime":1377043200,"reviewTime":"08 21, 2013"}

Warm tube power amp that is both smooth and responsive. The digital voicing is direct and easy to set up. The fact that Fender has discontinued this model was a shock to me. It is one fine small amp that begs to be used in the recording studio. The direct out provideds a simple and easy way to hook up to the board for signal to recorder/mixer and still give you the amp's skeaker as a monitor for yourself. What could be easier? And it mikes well too, by the way. The choice is yours there.With no LED display (cost increase if one was there) and the plain use of volume and tone mixed with the drive, it's so simple to dial in a great tone that it just makes playing fun, and practicle too. The voiceing models from the amp selection are quite good and true to the amp that it replecates. The Tweed, Blackface, and Marshall voicing are all well done and lend to the overall tone of this fine little amp.Love the reverb in the FX section. The spring reverb is so well done that I bumped the amp once and was looking for the \"spring chrash\" known from amps with the real spring reverb. It's that good. Once again, the controls are easy and direct. Never an issue to simply select a model and then dial it in with little effort. Who cares if it doen't have a floorboard with dozens of switches and such for channel selection? You want that, go waste your money on a Line 6 or something. This Champ is made for one thing. To give you the best possible tone and selection for the least amount of money and effort. I believe it has accomplished that well.Again, a shame that Fender has dropped this model from the line up of products. The super model is a step up in power and speaker size, but also the cost is higher as well. I'm just glad that I got one of these from Amazon. com when I did and will not part with the amp. Been playing for five decades now and I know when I have a good instrument or gear and when I don't. This model is a keeper to be sure. And I don't even like digital! How's that for an endorsement?

This thing gave me chills the first time I played it as my wife was staring at me with open mouth after I unboxed it and turned it on thinking at first \"you wasted our money on this\" which turned to \"dang this thing sounds good guess it's ok with me\" as I begin to shred on it with my p90 equipped les paul..The tons of effects are very nice and sound very realistic, and for 5 watts this think can play ridiculously loud and clear in a large living room or small venue, though I don't think it is loud enough for a drummer. It has line out and speaker out which is great, and this amp has nice build quality. Plus it's on sale right now so snatch one before they're all gone. I would gig with this miked or even record with it and plug the line out right into recording device. Note that this thing takes about 15 seconds to warm up so you can't just flip it on and play instantly (not a huge deal, just turn it on before you get situated). I wish they could have crammed a 10 inch speaker in it, though the 8 inch in there sounds rather decent for what it is and is very efficient. So stop thinking about it and just go buy it!","summary":"This one's a keeper!","unixReviewTime":1333152000,"reviewTime":"03 31, 2012"}

It's a classic Fender and I was looking for something of good quality with great price.2. Sounds clear and crystal good, unplugged.3. This can be subjective but I think this BulletStrat is more comfortable than a Les Paul simply because it's wider and thinner.4. All the previous four ratings here on Amazon and even higher ratings on Musician's friend.Things I don't like much:1. 15th fret of lower E string is dead, and like always I take quality control into my rating account.(I don't want to bother go to a local shop for a fix, never mention that's $20 in addition)2. I couldn't figure out why the tune nob never changed the sound (like not a bit)? (I'm new to electric but my Les Paul does change tunes... in a much much more obvious way)3. Talking about plugged sound, it's no where close to unplugged. Notes are pretty mixed up and not separated/clear, very loud though.4. I don't know if it's universal, I ordered new and get it with dirty plastic cover with scratches. What's worse is, they place this nasty cover in between of the panel and the components upon it which makes it impossible to remove... (I', not even sure if I can call it a protective cover because it's pretty weak and thin.)This is overall an OK guitar, consider its price it can be made at least slightly better. For beginners on budget with less than $200, I would recommend go for the better ones with a little more price. For example, me, I got a SX Deimos ($175) Les Paul which I'm in love with now. Simply everything about it is better, and I finally get the feelings of an electric. I'm glad I don't need to stuck with this anymore.According to Amazon,3 Stars - It's OK4 Stars - I like it5 Stars - I love it3 Stars Checked, it really IS just an OKAY guitar to me.Thanks for reading, and hope people find their beloved guitars!","summary":"Do I expect TOO MUCH?","unixReviewTime":1328659200,"reviewTime":"02 8, 2012"}

One was in the SKB Fender case ($99.95 on Amazon), the other in a Gator case purchased locally.  I was told it was just as good as the Fender case. Both ended up in checked luggage.  After 1 flight from Florida to LAX and back (non-stop, minimal handling) the glue on the top section of the Gator case gave up.  The padding is now loose and the strap to keep the top from flopping completely open is dangling inside the case.  Neither guitar was damaged and the cases appear in fine shape, but with the padding loose, the Gator case is going to require some repair before it can be used again. Other than a couple of scuff marks on the SKB Fender case, it's as good as new.  I just ordered another SKB Fender case.

Everything you can imagine. This AMP ranks up there with the best of them. I'm surprised as I've hated (with a passion) every DSP solid state amp I've ever played. This hybrid is incredible. The effects are excellent. The built in compression is amazing and the amp works excellent for recording. It has many onboard effects but I have racks and pedals that outdo those, so I don't use them for recording.It's not a band amp unless you're an acoustic band or your drummer has electronic drums. It's 15 Watts, but it's loud... it's just not quite loud enough to get those cleans over the drums, though you might be fine for overdrive -- depending on the venue and situation.It's not going to emulate certain amps like a VOX very well, but it does excellent with a Fender Black face (excluding the tube reverb). It does a Bassman ok, but doesn't quite capture that chime and nuisances tone of the original '59 Bassman. Doesn't cost $11,000 dollars other. It does a Marshall pretty well. Marshall's based on '59 Bassman without the delicate touch, so there's no wonder. The acoustic gives a very clean sound and makes that clean sound more full, yet doesn't sound like a filter. 0, 6, 7, 9 and 12 are amazing voices. You can bypass that and use  it without effects or voicing and it sounds a lot like the original Super Champ.I also have a 2x12 Vintage 30 box I connect it to for even more of a wonderful fully dynamic and full rich sound. When I'm just playing around the house or need a quick recording and don't wanna have to dial in sounds with my Vox AC30 or Fender Deluxe Reverb then this my amp of choice. It is miles ahead of a Fender Blues Deluxe.Yes, this is indeed the best amp you will find for the price and the most versatile amp I've played outside of a $2000 mesa boogie.Buy it. In fact, buy two. This is a future classic.","summary":"I have more AMPS than most people have TV's.","unixReviewTime":1308268800,"reviewTime":"06 17, 2011"}

Forget the fact that you have Digital amp models built in too, you also have a 15w Champ tube amp with a 10 inch speaker.  It's not exactly a '57 champ reissue, but it is the same circuit with all of the character and spanky tone as any Champ out there.  (People who like a great Champ tone, would pay more than $299 for a great 15w Champ amp.)Add to this, 16 Digital Presets.  Fender gives you Digital models through a Tube Circuit of Tweed Amps, Blackface Amps, Hot Rod Amps, as well as Metal Amps, A Jazz amp and an Acoustic sounding Model.Add to that some preset digital effects including Reverb, Delay, Vibe, Trem and Chorus.  (Each one has several choices as well as a knob to increase or decrease the presence of the effect.)Everyone who reviews this amp raves about the how authentic and interesting the Digital Models are... and they are absolutely right.But this amp breaks new ground with the simple fact that you can switch directly from playing a song with a Tweed or Hot Rod tone directly to an authentic Champ amp.  Not a model of a Champ Amp, the real deal!The implications of this amp are really huge.  I'd love to see Fender do the same thing with a Pro Jr. or even a Blues Jr. Amp.  Perhaps they might go that direction in the future depending on the success of this amp.  who knows.  But what I do know is that this amp is simply bursting with character.The Digital PresetsFor me, the highlights are the authenticity of the Tweed, Blackface and Hot Rod tones.  I really feel like channel 10 sounds like a clean blues jr coming through the 10 inch speaker.  The tweed tones are syruppy and awesome.  The Blackface clean sounds like a Princeton, and I even think they were trying to emulate a Deluxe Reverb on channel 5.As Far as Volume...People ask, is it loud enough to gig with?  Sure.  It can get loud enough over drums etc.  But, I'd mic it anyway.  I get my best overdriven tones in the midrange of the volume.  Mic it and you can play it anywhere.The Only downsides...As much as Fender tries to throw a bone to metal heads, this amp really doesn't give Metalheads that much to work with.  It would be a great practice amp for any guitarist, Blues, Metal, Jazz or Country...But the Metal tones are not going to be as big and rectified as you would want them if you want to chug through some metallica riffs.Lack of a Mid Control.  I'm not sure that I understand why you'd have an EQ with Treble and Bass with no Mid control.  Personally, it's the EQ knob that I would use the most, but if you are switching between Digital Presets you have to work with the Treble and Bass to find the sweet spot for your mids.  To my ears, it's not in the same spot on all presets.  That one knob would make this amp a lot quicker and easier to use for someone like me who likes to bounce between presets.This amp is cool and unique. Which is why it will be the first digital modeling amp that is still worth something when Fender releases the next big new thing.  Line 6 and Vox tube/digital combos have really fallen quite flat and have no resale value after the next generation comes out.  Fender has found a sweet spot of value, quality and usability.  This is going to be a rare technological achievement that people will still hang on to and be happy with 10 years later.Truly a unique and versatile creation.","summary":"Whoa!

They are stiffer than the 551s and perhaps a touch less stiff than the IIIs (and thinner than the IIIs too).One thing that may account for the nice way the Black Ice perform is that the edges are beveled and smoothly finished in a way which differs from the 551s (which I still like) and from the Jazz IIIs.In terms of playability, they are about the same to me as any other pick of this shape and stiffness.But the most important thing to me is the hardest thing to communicate to you:  The tone.  I love the tone I get with these picks, and the best I can do for you is to say that I was looking for a pick that would generate a solid, mellow jazz tone with an archtop - a tone that reminds me of say, Barney Kessel (but without Barney's chops of coursse).

With each attenuation setting, I had to adjust the input volume accordingly.  This device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops.

{"reviewerID":"A1MV8LXEXO8EWC","asin":"B002C741BI","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"The Ideator\"","helpful":"[0, 0]","reviewText":"I bought this pickup for placement in two ukeleles I own.The first ukelele was a Lanakai LU-21.  It installed pretty easily, except the adhesive lost its adhesion after I moved the pickup to a new location within the soundbox.  I need to get some stronger carpet tape or new adhesive to secure it more permanently in its new location.  It sounded great though -- several people commented on how loud and sweet the instrument sounded through a guitar amplifer and also through a mixer, amp and PA system.  We did have to boost the gain on the mixer significantly to get adequate volume, but we were able to project enough sound to do a dance for about 100 people.  Straight into a guitar amp, it gave plenty of volume.Happy with the results, I then installed a second one in a Mahalo painted/economy ukelele available here on Amazon.  The installation went well except the endpin jack wouldn't \"stay put\" in the sound hole.  On my Lanakai this was not a problem -- there is a ragged washer which goes on the inside of the endpin jack which is supposed to bite into the wood on the inside of the instrument.  It is supposed to stop the endpin jack from turning when you screw on a strap pin/bolt onto the endpin jack from the outside of the instrument.  On the Lanakai, this ragged-edged washer bit into the softer mahogany-like wood easily and did its job very well.  On the Mahalo, which is a smooth maple or pine, the ragged washer couldn't bite into the wood.  As a result, the endpin jack turned and turned when I tried to screw on the outer bolt/strap button and never went on tight enough.  I had to put masking tape around the end pin jack to make it fit snugly in the hole I created in the end block of the ukelele.  THEN there was enough resistance to allow me to install the strap button/end bolt very tightly.My biggest beef with this unit is the fact that it takes a 15/32 hole to fit it snugly in the ukelele.  This is an odd size, so you end up using a 7/16 drill bit which is common in most handyman drill bit sets.  Because this is too small, you have to make the hole 1/32\" larger by whatever means you have available.  This was an agonizingly slow process when I tried to do it by hand, using a dowel with sandpaper wrapped around it.  A peg-hole reamer might have done a better job, but I didn't have one.So, I eventually found a dowel and glued some sandpaper to it, shoved it in my drill press, and slowly lifted my 7/16\" hole in the ukelele into the spinning sanpaper dowel.  This took care of the sizing problem in a matter of seconds, although it was not a really tight fit, and necessitated the use of masking tape around the endpin jack in the Mahalo to stablize it in the hole.Also, the directions don't tell you much about the placement of the 3 nuts, 2 flat washers, ragged washer, and strap button/bolt that goes on the end of the jack.  I did it his way, starting from the inside of the ukelele:(Bolt1-Bolt2-thin washer-ragged washer)-- WALL OF THE UKELELE -- (outer thick washer, outer bolt3, outer strap pin/bolt).  The purpose of bolt1 is to stabilize bolt2.  This sequence of pieces worked on both instruments in which I installed the pickup.Overall, when played through different guitar amps, as well as a mixer/amp/PA system, I was pleased with the results of this unit in a ukelele.  I would buy another if I needed to amplify yet another accoustic instrument.","summary":"Good sounding pickup through an amplifier","unixReviewTime":1296432000,"reviewTime":"01 31, 2011"}

It worked great right out of the box: put in the battery, clipped it onto a standard acoustic guitar headstock, turned it on, and began tuning. The display is big ( 1-1/4\" X 1-1/4 \"), bright even in a bright room, and when the string is in-tune, the backlit background turns from red to green( like Christmas!). I put on a brand new set of strings, and used it to bring each one up to pitch. I found that plucking the string with your finger and then adjusting makes the tuner \"waver\" less, probably because fewer overtones are being produced. All of these type of tuners have some degree of hesitancy when reading the string pitch, moreso on some of the strings than others, but I found that this unit locked in on the signal quickly and gave a very accurate reading. I can use a pick to pluck the string as well and this device, after a very brief pause( less than a 10th of a second), gives me a reading or gives me the green. I don't use any of the other features. I also did not use it to tune any other stringed instrument.The only other comment I have about it is that the on button should have been placed on the top of the unit as you clip it onto the headstock, but I just mount the unit over towards one side, and turn it on and off from the bottom.I would highly recommend this for a anyone looking to quickly tune-up a guitar in a noisy, dimly-lit room.Update-August 2012: Replaced the battery after 2 years, with a good quality Sony lithium, and the tuner is still going strong!","summary":"It works for me","unixReviewTime":1270771200,"reviewTime":"04 9, 2010"}

That has been the case with all the clean boosters on the market like MXR Micro Amp, EHX LPB-1, BBE Boosta Grande, Modtone, etc.  They keep your guitar's original tone, make it louder and when pushed enough, will add a good amount of gain & grit.  But there is something else going on with the Xotic EP Booster.  Yes, it also makes the signal louder, adds gain or a little dirt, but also makes your overall sound bigger & wider!  Based on vintage echoplex units used by guitar heroes like Jimmy Page, Duane Allman, Gary Moore, etc.  This pedal is really small in size, has one knob & the footswitch.

The Blues Jr. has a somewhat small enclosure for a 1x12 and I felt it had a bit of a \"boxy\" tone, otherwise, it's a great amp. The Ibanez has a classic Tube Screamer circuit built in and a switch which cuts the wattage in half for playing at lower volumes, but it lacked a reverb circuit, which was a deal breaker (silly reasoning, I know). The AC15 has a larger enclosure than the Blues Jr., and it has a reverb AND tremolo circuit, so it had the features I was looking for and most importantly, it produces some killer tone.If you've ever seen or read a review of this amp, chances are, you've heard about the classic VOX \"chime\", which this amp has, but I fell in love with the natural tube saturation on the top boost channel right away. The normal channel will break up nicely too, but I would suggest an A/B switch and run the normal channel fairly clean and the top boost pretty dirty.I was worried at first that 15 watts wouldn't be enough, but fear not, this amp is LOUD... maybe too loud as I'm just a hobbyist that plays in the bedroom, but that's not a bad thing. It totally blows away my 100 watt Marshall solid state and I haven't put the volume much past 8 O'clock for fear that my wife may beat me to death if I do.While there is no effects loop, it takes pedals well, but for distorted tones, I've found myself just plugging straight in just to get the unadulterated tube crunch, which I've come to love so much. As stated above, the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp, or as previously stated, running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an A/B switch to go between them. As far as other effects, I really like what it does to my TC Electronic Flashback Delay and Corona Chorus. Note that there is a foot switch jack in the back panel, but it controls the on/off for the built in tremolo and reverb, but it's sadly not included with the amp.For my first tube amp, I don't think I could have done much better; I love the tone that I can get, the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp, it's feature rich, and takes pedals well. The other two amps that I was considering were a little less expensive, and while I really feel that the VOX is just a better all around amp, I don't think you can go wrong with any one of the three.The weight (about 50 lbs), and the lack of an included foot switch are really the only two cons that I can think of. While I would have picked up all three of the amps that I was looking at if I had the means, I would not hesitate to recommend this amp to anyone looking for their first or next tube amp.","summary":"Great tube amp!","unixReviewTime":1343433600,"reviewTime":"07 28, 2012"}

It illuminates my entire largeManhasset M54 Regal Conductor's Music Standquite well by itself.Having said that, for a 40 bucks light, it feels rather flimsy to me. In both construction and light brightness, it does not compare well with traditional clamp or desk lights, all of which are usually much cheaper (the issue being mainly the light switch, the jury is out about the clamp, though it seems strong). Of course, as an orchestra light, it couldn't be much brighter without defeating its intended purpose, I am just pointing out that I feel it isn't worth 40 dollars, when you consider the whole field of similar lights (those not intended for orchestra).I bought this because of reputation and reviews, but it should probably cost the same as its closest competitor, theRechargeable Music Stand LED Light Clip-on 9 LEDS with Adapter.  That one has the same negative issues as this light, but at a much more acceptable $18.99 plus free shipping.One more thing, you should ignore the \"Frequently Bought Together\" suggestion to get theMighty Bright 80910 Bright Light Cradlefor this light.

This one puts them all in the shade (pun intended; sorry).The 9-LED bar spreads the light well in a wide fan pattern. The light is concentrated in the desired area and doesn't spread everywhere like it does with incandescent lights. The little fin at the back of the light is very good in keeping it from being an annoyance to other musicians when it's pointed back at the music. The light is two-level: normal and BRIGHT! Normal is plenty good enough for shows in a darkened theater. The fact that the light is white rather than the yellow typical of stand-light bulbs is a definite plus. If you need to put a color filter over it, you don't have to worry about a hot bulb melting holes in the filter. The light spread is so smooth and consistent that I don't have to waste time maneuvering the heads to find the optimum light pattern like is necessary with two-head stand lights.The gooseneck is reasonably stiff and should hold up well. The included AC adapter has a much longer cord than typical for these lights. The included zipper case is fairly big and bulky, but will squash down as much as possible in an instrument case or bag. It has a pocket inside the upper part for batteries, a clip attachment for the light base and elastic holders for the top of the light, and a small pocket for the AC adapter. It's hard to fit the adapter cable back into the pocket, but there's plenty of room for it in the case. I don't know about battery life yet, but at least they include a pack with the light just like they included the AC adapter (usually an optional purchase).This light is a bit large compared to other LED stand lights, but it's so good that I don't really care.

I attempted to move to tube amps becuase I wanted to set up a pedal board and dial in my own effects. And really, any reading you do on web pages will eventually take to tubes. I went Vox AC4 and realized I didn't want a tube that already has a defined and limited sound (no fault of the amp - I just had to experience it myself). I also didn't want a modeler impersonating a tube. I loved the Orange Crush, but it was totally unreliable.Enter the ZT. Holy-moley. The amp has limited gain available to give you traditional tube behavior. Nice break up, very reactive to your playing and literally miles of clean head room. But unlike those tube amps - my pedals can come into play and I can manipulate that clean sound at any level without losing a bit of clarity or depth. It also has an iPod jack, headphone jack and ambiance (i.e. make it sound kind of boxy). It does not model. Like the Crush or Roland Cube, it has it's own voice. I've heard it compars to a Fender Tweed in tone. I guess I can see that, but it still has it's own voice - which is important to me in any amp. I should note - an AC30 or Fender Twin or high end 1x12 Tube still are louder and much fuller. But we're talking $1000+ tube amps.I don't have the matching extension cabinet because I just don't need it. It is REALLY loud. I have a Mustang III and it gets destroyed by the ZT. At 75% volume on the dial, I can hit my DS-1 and actually make out the notes. That is something the Vox AC4 or Fender Blues Junior cannot do without getting muddy. It is fully giggable. I haven't played live with it yet, but in a rehearsel environment, keeping with a loud drummer is no issue. A friend plugged it into his Marshall 4x12 and it was thunderous. Really, just stupid powerful for $300.For blues, jazz or light rock, it's brilliant right out of the box. It not only can do medal with a pedal board, but check youtube for videos of the Lunchbox being played in a live setting by a metal band. It has tube power in 10 lbs with solid state flexibility. I would also encourage anyone to scour the net for reviews and video. You simply will not find a negative thing about the ZT Lunchbox anywhere. It really is a solid state aimed to take prefessionals away from their bigger, heavier, more expensive tubes. If you play effect laden music, boy are you going to have a hard time walking away from the ZT.If there is a drawback - $300 for a solid state amp that really needs external pedals to shine could be a turn off for some - especially for players looking for a swiss army knife for an amp.

Using it couldn't be simpler, and it has excellent contrast. I would say it was the best clip-on tuner I've had a chance to use, except that it broke the first time I carried it in my gig bag to a rehearsal. One of the little fingers that holds the \"ball\" in the \"socket\" on the back of the tuner broke off, so the tuner and the clip are now separate pieces. This model works only by vibration unlike the red one, so without the clip, it is not very useful (it is possible to hold it against the head stock and still use it, but it isn't very convenient). I would just super-glue it together at a good angle, but I have to put it in different positions on different instruments. I've seen a number of complaints elsewhere about this same problem, so I would call it a design weakness.Despite the negatives, I would buy another if they beefed up the construction or sold it with a hard protective case.Update 4/4/13: Added back a star. I'm still managing to use it after hobbling together a fix involving a rubber sink washer. Even with a slightly compromised mount, it continues to provide excellent results. I recently purchased a replacement, the SN-8(B), but found it really disappointing. So much so I may send it back. I also tried a Planet Waves Mini Headstock Tuner, which no matter how much I try, I simply cannot love. So I just ordered another one of these. Despite the ball socket issue, it is still one of the best tuners I've ever used.

Attractive but not overly loud in color, and a nice non-slip surface.

I never thought a clip on could be as accurate and dependable as my Boss.  The GoGo is awesome and instantly became the only tuner I use.  But now I have to say, I think the Snark is a little better. I bought the SN-1 and the SN-2 because they are so inexpensive and so amazingly accurate.  The other great thing is they are chormatic, so besides being a great tuner, you can leave it clipped on to the headstock to practice accurate string bending or just learning the notes on the fretboard. The display is very easy to read...better than the GoGo (although GoGo has a new improved display since I bought mine).  I love the colors and the matte finish too.  The rubbery matte finish makes gripping the clip much easier than the smooth plastic of other tuners. The rubber surface also makes opening the battery compartment a snap too, I had to fight like heck to get the battery door open on my GoGo.

I cannot say anything about durability for now, but I'll update this review if it breaks.====One of my kids has been borrowing my trusty old BOSS TU-12 chromatic tuner forever for her violin, and I finally bought this for her.There are many clip-on tuners, but I liked the following about this tuner:1. LCD mimicing an analog needle so you know how much you're off (as opposed to just flat or sharp).2. You can switch between vibration sensor and an internal mic. Most of the time you want to use vibration sensor anyway, but a mic sometimes comes in handy.3. Can set different pitch than A=440.4. Not expensive (was less than [...]$ including shipping).Upon delivery I tried it on my guitars (both acoustic and electric) using vibration sensor before giving it to my kid, and was impressed.It is quick to track the note even for low E. It's not picky about where on the peghead it is clipped on. No stress whatsoever, indeed it's just as quick and smooth as my BOSS. LCD is bright and clear, and needle-ish display works as expected.It worked very well on violin too. And I saw kids singing to internal mic to check the pitch of their voices just for fun.And a note about the looks. From the picture I expected it to be ugly, but actually it was not that bad. It's tiny and doesn't look like a Fisher-Price product.====First update, Nov 24 2010: I've tried it on an electric bass (4 string), and it worked equally well. Still 5 stars.====Second update, Oct 20 2011: It's still working happily for my daughter, and I bought a second unit for myself.

The Snowball screws right in (unscrew the holder thing that comes on there, screw the snowball in, win).3. After some research, I found that this will fit pretty much any mic. Cool.4. It seems sturdy and well built.Cons1. The legs make this thing very, very wide. It's about 2/3 the size of my keyboard which means it takes up a lot of space.2. The mechanism to retract the legs is a little weird. Not bad, just weird.Overall, this is highly recommended for a desk stand.

It's similar in size to an MXR stompbox, though the knobs are more reminiscent of a BOSS.  Delay is a very simple effect that is increasingly available on modeling amplifiers to cheap plastic entry-level pedals.I really have no complaints about the Analog Delay in terms of how it performs and sounds.  It does a good job of creating that ambient short delay sound up to about 320ms, or slapback rockabilly on quicker repeats.  It's just too bad that they weren't able to stretch out the delay time a little longer, perhaps to 450ms or 500ms.  Once you get into that territory, there's a much broader array of things you can play, including the U2-style phrasing repeats.  That being said, a digital delay is probably better for that task anyway.But it isn't fair to compare this pedal to an MXR Carbon Copy, and if you're looking for something cheap and surprisingly high-quality to provide ambiance, the Rogue will do just fine.","summary":"Great value, but limited to slapback and shorter delays","unixReviewTime":1373846400,"reviewTime":"07 15, 2013"}

My reason for buying this is because I don't have to learn how to play the ukulele and can play the guitarlele using the knowledge I already have - yea!It is very similar to a guitar in many important ways.  It has the same 6 strings tuned the same way.  However, and this is VERY important so please read carefully:  To get the best sound out of your new guitarlele you must tune each string up in pitch.  For example, let's take the 6th string (lowest) and tune it up to A instead of E.  Clip on your electronic guitar tuner and crank that string up a bit until the tuner reads \"A\".  It will be the same pitch as the actual 5th string on the guitar.So here's the breakdown on tuning each string:6th = A5th = D4th = G3rd = C2nd = E1st = AYou really need to to tune it this way because otherwise the strings are too floppy and you won't get that beautiful ukulele voice.  The action is very good and it will not be any harder to play.The instrument overall is fairly easy to play, especially in the lower positions.  I have trouble holding it because I'm used to holding a classical guitar so I always have to make adjustments to get used to it.  Barring chords especially higher up the neck is kind of tough because the frets are so close together so I usually play easier stuff.  Also, I have discovered that certain types of music really play well and others aren't so good.  Almost all Celtic music sounds great!  Christmas carols are lovely, but Spanish stuff doesn't sound so great, imho.  The instrument just doesn't have enough power to carry some types of music.  Blues are good, and very ancient sounding tunes like those that would have been played on a 4 course guitar from back around the 15th century sound really cool on the guitarlele.  It seems to be well constructed, the tuning gears work well, the action is good, frets are inserted straight and level so I really can't find anything to complain about, especially for the price.I would suggest keeping the tunes simple and have fun!  It's just like a little guitar with all the same strings and same number of frets. You will probably have to tie a strap on it to hold it in place but that's not absolutely necessary, especially for those of you who are accustomed to playing small stringed instruments.I took it camping over the summer and had a great time playing it around the campfire in the evenings, something I've always wanted to do!  I'm quite fond of my guitarlele and am going to purchase another for my daughter so that we can play duets together on them!  :DUPDATE 4.10.13-------------------------------------------------------------------------I bought another guitarlele (this time from Amazon) and it is exactly like the one I purchased a few years ago.  This one is for my daughter and she is having a delightful time playing it.  We've been playing guitarlele duets together and they sound great and is such a fun thing to do!","summary":"Classical Guitar Instructor's Review - LOVE IT!!!","unixReviewTime":1324598400,"reviewTime":"12 23, 2011"}

While I haven't explored all of the sounds yet, I have found some useable ones.You really need to start off by finding and dialing in the effects you like and creating your own presets. Flipping through all of the categories and individual effects is not really practical for any live performance situation. Also, factory settings are almost never where you need them to be on these devices because the source signals from different instruments vary so much.Here are some that I've personally found to be appealing so far:Delay: Analog w/Mod- a nice sounding Memory Man style delay once you dial it in to not overwhelm your source signalReverb: Room- standard adjustable digital delay, not truly authentic by any stretch but does the trick when played over other musicEnvelope Filter: Tron Up- a Winner! fully functional and authentic envelope follower, FUNKY!Synthy: Seeker- a very cool filter for single guitar notes.Octave: Bass Octaver- One note below only but quite effective especially for loopers.You will also find (as expected with a multi-effects pedal) many unpractical, downright silly-sounding noise makers. Not to say you won't find a use for them here or there but they really exist as filler unless we're talking about a 4:20 headphones session ;) Also, don't depend on any strong distortions from this unit unless you're using it as an addition to your amp's lead channel.Construction seems pretty sturdy other than the \"Model Select\" button which is a multi-use knob with push-down / turn action and is cheapy-cheap. It's awkward and uncomfortable to use, fortunately you only really need it while setting the unit up. I already dislodged it from its proper vertical position once while making presets.Having the choice between True-Bypass and DSP is a really nice touch (and unheard of on stomp boxes) as people have different needs here depending on your signal chain.The tuner is quite functional if a little tough to read from standing position. I do miss my KORG Pitchblack with its big bright display but this one does the trick and saves me another pedal connection.I personally wanted things like octave, envelope, phaser, etc. available to me on stage without having to buy and wire in all those pedals for occasional use individually. The M5 is serving that purpose. The sounds will probably not cut it for the audiophile or analog purist. They should also not be depended on as any basis for your overall tone. Just a large bank of fun accents to add here and there in a very manageable and affordable package.","summary":"Economical And Useful","unixReviewTime":1330214400,"reviewTime":"02 26, 2012"}

I get a more extreme distortion from my old hissing Boss Mega Distion as an example.I like that the pedal has a wide array of uses. The build quality seems questionable from MXR. As others have posted, the box is very light and the knobs seem thinner than other MXR's, espeacially the older ones, but this pedal seems solid and makes no noise.The price and demo videos were the primary reason I bought this pedal and I am happy with it.

After two weeks of the returned item was delivered, I didn't hear anything from the seller regarding the return, so I emailed to the seller to see if we can settle it asap.  Too bad, four days after the email had been sent, I only got the email of telling me the case# of the message I sent without any further response to my refund.  until my patience is gone to deal with this hassle, and I don't think it's worth to waste more time on it, despite the fact of wasting the time and money I spent on this useless pickup and the shipping costs. Therefore, yesterday, I emailed my last contact to the seller regarding the refund of the purchase and gonna report this to AMAZON about the bad after-sale service I ever have before if I still haven't heard from the seller shorty.Today, I finally received the seller's response to my refund, the seller denies the issues of the pickup and claims, \"it was not defective. All pickups are going to get unwanted noise if you move the guitar. The feedback can be to to many other issues. I have issued the refund of $7.04.\"  Obviously, the reply is unconvincing; although the feedback can be raised from varies issues, i have tried with another pickup to the same directions and setups, but it doesn't have such problems at all.  The fact is NOT ALL pickups get UNWANTED noise although I didn't try many pickups.  Cherub Guitar Pickup doesn't work as the product description to pickup the original tones of the instrument regardless the surrounding noises.  Moreover, the unwanted loud noise from its wire movements is really annoying, and there's no way to stop the wire movements while strumming. Indeed, I won't use it, and I don't want it to sit at my house as a useless property, so returning back to the seller may help to improve the issues it has.  However, the hassles I got from the seller is totally unexpected and it's NOT worth at all.By the way, I'm also unhappy about the refund of &7.04, I bought it for $8.79 along with AMAZON Free Shipping of the purchase of $25 or more.  To me, it is not the money of $1.75, but it's not fair to the buyer, who doesn't get the right service and quality from the purchase but only wastes the times and money on this matter. So if you really need a pickup for your instrument, I highly recommend you to spend few more dollars to get a much better and reliable one. Don't make the same mistake as I did to try this one because of the cheap price, in turn, you may get more hassles than you expect on such cheap merchandise.  I don't want that happens to anyone else, so I decided to tell you what I went through to keep you from the possible hassles before betting on it.2 STARS FOR THE 1ST REVIEW AFTER USING IT TWICE:I like the clip-on design, which is easy to use, so it is worth 2 stars; however, it doesn't work well clipping on small soundholed string instruments like ukes and kid size guitars because it touches the strings.  Besides that, it also picks up loudly through the wire's own movements, not as the description \"regardless the surrounding noises.\"  I have distressed from those unwanted loud noises.  One more thing that it somehow produces much higher feedback to the mini amp that I use, and I have to turn the volume as low as possible to prevent the high frequency of feedback. However, when I switch to another pickup with the same setup on mini amp and acoustic guitars or uke. the amp doesn't have any feedback even turning it to almost the highest volume, and the other pickup doesn't have the unwanted noise from its own movement either.  I don't know whether is my lack of luck or the poor pickup I got ... I bought it because its cheap price (less than $9) & clip-on design, but, I can't accept the noises and I have to waste my shipping cost to return it back to the seller. So, if you want to give it a try, you may bear in mind that the seller, BrookMays, doesn't take any responsibility for the shipments even the item doesn't work properly as claimed description.

It works smoothly without any issues, and allows me to tune my guitar swiftly and accurately.  All you need to do is clamp the tuner to the headstock, and it is ready to go.  The SN5 is smaller than I expected, but the multicolored meter is easily readable, and the meter can adjusted so that it can be seen clearly from any position.Using the color coded meter, you can tell whether a string is flat or sharp, and adjust the string tension accordingly.  With a little practice, tuning becomes a quick and easy process.  The unit is powered by a CR 2032 battery, which generally has a long life.Although the clamp has rubber pads, apparently the finishes of certain guitars could still be prone to damage.  The instructions states that the Snark is not recommended for guitars with the following finishes, polyurethane, French polish, and nitrocellulose lacquer.  Those with Gibson, Gretch, or Taylor guitars may want pay particular attention to this warning.  I have had no problems using this tuner on Kramer, Ibanez, Charvel, Epiphone, and ESP guitars.  The tuner also works for bass guitars and violins.  I do not have either of those instruments, but I imagine the tuner would work much the same.As there are a number of guitar tuners that attach to the headstock, it took me a little while to decide on the SN5.  Even after eliminating tuners by D'Addario and Planet Waves, selecting the SN5 wasn't that simple, as Snark makes a number of similar tuners.  I am completely satisfied with the SN5, and believe that it fully deserves a 5 star rating.  It is also the least expensive, of the tuners I was considering buying.

{"reviewerID":"AG8FGAIPRBKIR","asin":"B004Z8VQ2O","reviewerName":"Jolly Roger","helpful":"[52, 53]","reviewText":"If you are like me, my research for a guitar connection to my iPad left me with choosing between the iRiffport and the Jam.  I recently purchased, and then returned, the iRiffport.  I am very pleased that I purchased the Apogee Jam as a replacement.  Here are the reasons why:1) The connector on the iRiffport (the one that goes into the iPad) is not a strong connection at all; it feels as though it could disconnect at any time.  I have a stand to put my iPad on when jamming such that the iPad is in landscape mode, so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way.  With the Apogee Jam, the connector is just like the iPad's connector, except it ALSO has the \"prongs\" that come out of it, securing the connector into the iPad.  To remove the connector from the iPad, you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the \"prongs\" go in so it can be removed...very, very secure.  I use the \"Gumdrop\" case on my iPad, which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used.  This flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used.  IMPORTANT:  if you have such an iPad case, like me, I certainly feel that the Jam will provide a much more secure connection to your iPad over the iRiffport.  In fact, the structure of the iRiffport connector was so large, that I felt that it did not fit well through my case.  On the other hand, the Jam's connector is the same small size as the iPad's original connector.  This is also something to consider if you intend to use your iPad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the iPad.2) Probably the largest reason I prefer the Jam over the iRiffport:  you can hear sound directly from the iPad.  With the iRiffport, you MUST use headphones or attach external speakers.  I tried headphones with the iRiffport and playing the guitar was very awkward.  Nonetheless, with the Jam, I could attach headphones or external speakers to the iPad if I chose to do so.  I wanted something that could make my iPad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house, without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers.  With the Jam, I have this.3) The Jam has a gain meter (i.e., an LED) and a gain control.  The iRiffport does not.  When not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio, the LED lets you know if you are connected to the iPad, but not to any software (blue light), or if you are connected to the iPad AND to a software application (green light).  There are no batteries needed for the Jam or the iRiffport.4) I personally like that I can use my own guitar cord with the Jam.  If the cord breaks, I simply replace the cord, not my iPad connection device.  The iRiffport uses its own cord, and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my \"normal\" guitar cable I used with the Jam.5)  Although a fairly minor point, it is nice to know that the Jam is advertised by Apple (look at their website and their Garageband video).  And, since I have Garageband on my iPad, I was pleased to see that the advertising material on the Jam states specifically that it works with Garageband.So far, I'm very pleased with the Jam.","summary":"Apogee Jam vs. iRiffport","unixReviewTime":1327276800,"reviewTime":"01 23, 2012"}

It won't be easy, but if you get some leverage on it with a flathead or something you can wedge it off. I was able to get everything off my older board, and it came off so clean I was actually able to sell it! So this is some good stuff!

I was looking for a guitar with enough space between strings so that my fingers would not mute strings accidentally while practicing cords. I prefer guitars having solid woods, not laminated like this one. It has the ability to plug into an amp, has easy access to the battery, has a built in easy to use tuner, and the wiring dose not rattle about. It has a good compensated saddle, the frets are level and do not buzz, has a truss rod in the neck, and has a bound rosewood fingerboard. I have always liked the sound of classic guitars, like the option to plug in, and am more impressed by sound than brand name.A person who has small fingers might be better off looking for a narrower neck. This is not a small guitar or a thin body guitar. It rings out very well, so it is not a quiet guitar but is not likely to disturb your neighbors unless plugged in.Mine has some edges not well stained, likely due to glue squeeze out during assembly. Top is a bit wavy, from buffing. Still has some orange peel but not a lot.  Lastly, the nut and saddle are too high for my preference. Some people may be turned off by the orange color of the top, sort of a classic color that I have gotten used to now.Other guitars in this price range are typically made with laminated tops or backs, this model is not. I was not clear enough above where I mentioned laminated woods.If something happened to it, I would be likely to replace it with another one just like it.

I'd been looking for a cheap way to upgrade from USB-powered mics like the Blue Snowball to something a little more professional and, of course, that requires a mixer with these kinds of hookups.Thus, I am an amateur and you'll probably get more accurate ratings out of a professional.Anyway, my pros and consPros1. This thing is way smaller than I expected. I can hold it in one hand without any difficulty and that means it doesn't take up a lot of desk space. It fits well where I put it.2. It works as intended. I use this with a GLS ES-57 mic and this mixer is powerful enough to power it and make it sound good. I have my windows volume set at 75 and the gain is up at about 60%. I have no hissing and no problems. I did a podcast with this set up today and my podcast co-host (we do it over Skype) said I sounded very clear and my voice sounded strong and good. This is a stark improvement over the Blue Snowball.3. It's plug and play. I plugged it in, it installed the drivers, and it automatically set itself as the default microphone. Easy peasy.4. I use Reaper as my audio software and Reaper recognized it immediately.5. The dials and everything was easy to understand.Cons1. You can't plug this into a USB hub (or even an AC-powered USB hub) otherwise you'll get a hiss. This needs to be plugged directly into a computer.2. This high-jacks your audio defaults in Windows. To fix it, open your Control Panel, open the Sound, and set your Playback device to your speakers to fix the problem. Your sound will come out through your speakers as intended. Since I use this as my main mic, I left it as default in the Sound settings.Overall, for the price, this is an amazing little mixer for beginners and amateurs. I know there are better options but they are also more expensive and I'm on a budget. It's a great way to get into the world of sound without spending a lot more money. If you're like me and a single person doing YouTube video voice overs or podcasts, this is perfect for a home studio set up where you only need one person. Worth every penny as long as it lasts. I'll update when/if it breaks down but until then, I do not regret this purchase.","summary":"Nifty little guy","unixReviewTime":1392595200,"reviewTime":"02 17, 2014"}

I have even sold the picks at garage sales (25 cents each).  My favorite cards to use are the iTunes gift cards (careful cause some of the iTunes cards are cardstock).  They most replicate a Fender Med. pick.  Most credit cards are a bit thicker (somewhere between a Fender Med. and Heavy).  THey work well also (the edges do come out a little rough but I use an old emery board to clean them up quickly and easily).  I use the picks on both accostic and electric guitars with good results.  The best part is I am NEVER without a pick (even when people accidentally walk off with one.)  I do get funny looks at the stores when I ask for the used gift cards back (until I explain what I do with them- then the clerks are like &#34;wow thats so cool&#34;).  On average I can get 5 picks from a credit card (unless I'm going for a particular part of the card with a design on it).

The Snark was the better of the three in terms of accuracy, lock in speed, and visibility however I really dislike the \"eyeball on a stick\" form factor and refuse to use it on stage!  I like the fact that the NS is unobtrusive and can be left on the instrument, I even in leave 'em on in the case.

The tuner seems to be reasonably accurate, is lightweight, and is easy to read without being obtrusive to the audience.  It is also nice that such an inexpensive and small tuner can be adjusted to standards on either side of A-440.  Note that the photo of the tuner shows it on the headstock of a Fender-style electric guitar.  It works particularly well on the instrument shown because of the fact that the tuners are all on the same side of the headstock.  On something like a Gibson jazz guitar (ES-175, or one of the Epiphone or Ibanez clones, for example) it's more difficult to find an ideal place to attach the tuner.  Classical and acoustic steel-string guitars are also a tad problematic, too.  It's not that this tuner is unusable on other types of headstocks, it's just that the design limits where you can place it and still have it readable right-side up.  Some headstocks, too, may be too thick in order to attach this tuner.

You can't really get there without actual tubes being distorted.To me, its good for getting that kind of over the top, wild 80s midrangey Marshall sound.  To me though, it sounds too much like a pedal, and not enough like the real deal.  To me, the Hot Plexi sounds more \"real\", closer than this.  That being said, this pedal can be cleaner than the hot plexi.BUT, if you turn the tone down, and scoop your amps mids significantly (I'm talking about 2 of 10 on the knob, where 0 of 10 is too much and gives you \"Kill em all\" style hollowness that isn't good), it gives a nice dark, throaty, lower-mid rich tone that would be great for metal.  Yes, you're not supposed to scoop the mids on the amp, but this pedal is nothing but mids and scooping them tames the fizzyness.  So it's like Ghostbusters ....sometimes you just gotta cross the streams, and it works to filter out some of the harshness. I'm not even talking about Vintage Metallica scooped, its just scooped enough so it doesn't sound harsh in the high end and mids and sounds more like the Black Sabbath to Scandinavian metal tone I like to dial in (basically dark and dry, has a ton of mids but doesn't sound like Boston at all).I use it with a Marshall Class Five, pedal's tone at about 3 of 10.  Amps tone controls (Marshall Class 5 through a 4x12) at Bass 3, Mids 1 or 2, treble 6, set to headphone mode for a darker tone.","summary":"Cheesy or modern, your choice","unixReviewTime":1397692800,"reviewTime":"04 17, 2014"}

Now could you use it for a gig? Sure I suppose so, but bear in mind that it is not an \"in-line\" tuner therefore any excessive background noise will cause the accuracy to be a bit off.

Would also be OK with guitars.The nature of the hardware compensates for different thickness at the nut end of instruments and so should hold almost any guitar-like instrument within reason.

When solidly mounted, the hanger should be able to hold fairly heavy instruments - though I did not test that.For the cost these are a smoking deal. The alternatives I purchased for my music room & heavy bass guitars cost about 2x more and are not necessarily any better functionally.As mentioned there is no included hardware, but that is a non-issue as during install you may require installation to studs or with wall-board fasteners, depending on your situation and weight of your instrument.

Quickly though, I will start by also agreeing that for the price, it is hard to beat.  This is mostly why I have given it 4 stars and just bought a sixth one.  It is accurate, reliable for tuning, and affordable.  All that said, here is why I decided to write a review.  I have owned about 5 of these Snarks and every single one has broken after about 3-4 months use.  The unit itself is great.  Here is the problem.  Where the tuner attaches to the guitar and where the tuner attaches itself to it's own clip is where this little gem falls short.  Sure, if you put it on a guitar and leave it there at home, it will likely last at least a year and maybe longer requiring a battery change one day if you are lucky.  However, if you travel with it, take it on or off a few guitars a day, or frequently adjust it, it will likely eventually break.  Either the \"rubber feet\" that come into contact with the head stock of the guitar will come off and get lost or the little ball joint that connects the tuner's head to the clip part will break.  Best to get several of these at this great price and just keep one on each of your guitars.

I haven't used the sound versus vibration mode much, nor have I done much with the metronome function much--I can't speak to them; however, I am very pleased with the vibration tuning. Compared to the Fender, both will get your strings tuned well; what I like better about the Snark is there is a almost no dwell from the last note stuck before the next note registers. With the Fender, I feel I have to wait a few seconds for the screen to clear before striking again, and that adds up when moving from string to string.  The Snark is bulkier in the soft gig bag; the trade-off is any easy-to-read display. Lately, it's become my go-to tuner.","summary":"Nice!","unixReviewTime":1374969600,"reviewTime":"07 28, 2013"}

It's a little taller than the micro, but still very small and if it's behind a headstock it doesn't make a difference visually, the main difference is the height if the tuner, width and depth are about the same. That also means a bigger readout. So not really a con. I use it on a godin with a slotted headstock, positioned so I can see it between the tuning keys.

Back \"in the day,\" it was a bar of plastic held in place by a length of elastic. It didn't work very well but it is what was available to me. Later, some technology was applied to the need for a ubiquitously necessary accessory that would hold all six strings firmly in place (and in tune) as it was placed up and down the neck of the guitar WITHOUT doing anything to damage the fret board or finish of the guitar's neck. Many 'good' capos have been made. Until now, perhaps the best options have been G7 which fails in its 'softness' that allows strings to slip, and SCHUBB which, unfortunately, 'snaps' into place in a way that can injure the neck of the instrument.This new NS TRI-ACTION capo from Planet Waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively.Designed by Ned Steinberger (the \"NS\"), the Tri-Action works on a trigger/spring/lever mechanism that works all the way up and down the neck, fits perfectly on the first attempt, holds all six strings firmly in place and does so in a way that causes no abrupt jolt to the neck of the guitar. Both the G7s and the SCHUBBs are better known, more commonly used and more expensive. This is one of those rare instances where what you get is NOT what you pay for. D'Addario, the famous string maker that produces the Planet Waves line of guitar accessories)has done a remarkable and welcome job on these capos. Any guitar player who has gone from one to the other (capo) over time, searching for the one that really does what it is supposed to do all the time, will find this new capo from Planet Waves a welcome tool in the quest to produce clear tones and great sounds on a six-string guitar.","summary":"Finally: The Capo I have been waiting for!","unixReviewTime":1359244800,"reviewTime":"01 27, 2013"}

I previously had one of those bungie cord like capos, which was fine but it is a bit cumbersome.The other capos I looked into were Kyser and Schubb. Kyser is great because of its easy trigger grip. It's disadvantage however is that it has a lot of weighted tension on one side so it can knock your strings out of tune. The Schubb deals with this issue by having an adjustable tension spring that will adjust pressure according to the thickness of the neck. The problem with the Schubb, however, is that it can't really be manipulated with one hand and it can easily fall of the guitar.In comes the Planet Waves. It has a trigger grip so technically you can easily move it around the fretboard. However, because of the adjustable tension, you do need to adjust it when moving to a different neck thickness. It might rule out the one-handed ease but it does take care of Schubb's problem of falling off. In reality, I only found that I need to adjust the tension when switching between guitars or if I move up way up the fretboard. Between the 1st and 5th fret, I don't really need adjust. However, if for some reason I want to capo at the 7th, I do need to adjust the tension because it's too tight. In all, it's not that big a deal and it's nice to have the option to adjust the capo.In all, I'm happy. No capo is perfect. You can do partial capos with this one. Another review complained that it created buzz but all you need to do it adjust the tension.In case you aren't aware, this particular capo model only works on six string steel guitars. I have an electric guitar, a nylon and a Recording King ROS-06 with a chunky neck. Works great on the electric with the skinny neck and the ROS-06 with that chunky neck. Since the capo was built for guitars with a radius fretboard, it does not work on classical guitars (or anything with a flat fretboard). The capo will not reach across the entire fretboard and since the cap is curved, it will not apply pressure on the middle strings.It's a nice capo but it may not be what you're looking for so I recommend looking into the other two big hits in capos.","summary":"A nice compromise between a Kyser and a Schubb","unixReviewTime":1351900800,"reviewTime":"11 3, 2012"}

Got good gear?  This little amp will sound great.The DetailsThe amp itself is tiny.  I have an Electro-Harmonix pedal that's bigger than this amp! Still, it packs a punch.  With the gain at about 1/3 up and the volume at half, I get great clean tone and enough volume for a small venue.  Crank the gain up more and it gets louder and more distorted as you go.  Yes, this little amp will go from Jazz & Country to Rock & Metal with a twist of a dial.The line in and headphones jacks are a nice touch that none of my other amps have.  If you want to quietly play along with some tunes, you can.  Practice time just got better for your neighbors.The one lone tube in the Micro Terror is the pre-amp tube.  Mine came stock with a JJ Tubes 12AX7.  I understand that's standard.  A JJ is nice, but it will *not* warm up this little hybrid enough for you to get even a whiff of tube tone.  Dig out an old Phillips, RCA, Sylvania, or GE to get this guy to sound a bit like its big brother.  I had an old GE made in Great Britain lying around and popped it in my Micro Terror: warmed it right up; cleaned up a bunch of high-end tinniness.Still, compared to my two-tube BH5H or my all tube Champ, this guy does sound more solid state than anything.  BUT, compared to a buddy's Roland and solid state Ampeg, it's downright mellow.No effects loop means that your time-based effects (reverb, echo, chorus) can get noisy. So, if you like pedals, stock up on 9 volt batteries to avoid power adapter noise add in.Speaking of power adapters: a previous reviewer is right.  The external power brick for this guy seems fragile.  I'm not a fan of the thin line from the brick to the amp. It's holding up, but one round with my cat and I'll be looking for a new power supply.The RubAnnoyance #1:  One cheap cable anywhere in the mix will result in annoying HISS even at low volumes.  I found that out quickly.  So, get a proper speaker cable and a high end instrument cable or you will hate this amp.  I'm running it with a GLS 12 gauge speaker cable and a Planet Waves American Stage instrument cable - both available here at Amazon or any good guitar shop.Annoyance #2:  This is a 20 watt amp, right?  WELL... if you don't run a 4ohm speaker, you won't get all 20 watts.  The Micro Terror self-adjusts to the power needed to drive your speaker by stepping down output. (Yes yes... don't quote physics to me.)  At 8ohms, I still get good volume.  But at 16ohms (like my BH110) it sounds like a 5 or 7 watt amp.  That said, I'm actually a fan of the tone I get with my 8ohm Weber in its pine cab. The 8 inch Jensen speaker in my Champ, while nice, can't put out the low notes like I'd prefer and the Jensen Mod 10-50 is TOO clean.  But the Weber 10A125 sounds fantastic to my ears; even with the loss in volume.Annoyance #3: The Micro Terror is so small and so light, it'll tumble right to the floor if anyone kicks your chord.  Unlike a nice 20 pound amp, the chord won't pull out.

Edelman","helpful":"[0, 0]","reviewText":"I've been playing D'Addario XLs in their standard  .010, .011 and .013 gauge sets for many years now, so I was curious to see how these new \"balanced\" sets would feel. I expected a more even feel across the fingerboard, but experienced something quite different- right off, the B string felt a lot stiffer.  Looking at the tension table D'Addario publishes it's clear why this is the case. In the traditional .01s, the B string has about 30% lower tension that the E and G. In these new sets, the B is at the same tension, which is to say it's under 40% more tension than the B in the traditional set. That's a significant increase.  If you're used to the lower tension, the \"balanced\" tension feels a lot stiffer at first.The higher tension string requires a different amount of compensation at the bridge, too, which means changing the setup- not easily done on a Telecaster, where changing the length of the B changes the length of the E as well. Being higher in tension, the new B should require more compensation, since it'll shift pitch even more when you depress/stretch it. Since my Tele is currently set up as close as I could get the E and B to perfect comnpensation, I didn't feel like playing with it.After playing a while, the set started to feel more natural to me. I don't think I'll be changing gauges on the Tele right away, as I have about a dozen .010s in stock as well as over a dozen .013s fro my archtop. But I may experiment a bit with the new gauges for my Epiphone Dot Custom, which I string with .011s. I'm wondering if the balanced sets will give me a more even string-to-string feel, and if so, it would be worth my effort to change over.","summary":"They do feel different","unixReviewTime":1364860800,"reviewTime":"04 2, 2013"}

To record you simply press the button and the led will turn red, continue playing.  When done simply tap again and the LED goes to green and plays back.  At any time in the looping process if you want to overdub simply tap the button and record and tap to finish.  No need to line it up with the loop, it places your overdub exactly where you played it in the loop.  If you don't like the take a simple press and hold will erase the overdub. Want to stop and clear (two presses and press and hold) and your back to a clean slate.  I don't know the limit of overdubs but I haven't reached it.  The amount of time for the looping I believe is 5 min so you can record an entire song and overdub to your hearts content.  The tone preservation is excellent and haven't noticed any issues there.  You can get a nice variety if you put this at the end of your effects change so that you can record a rhythm that is dirty and crunchy and overdub and record, then turn off your distortion and overdub a very nice clean lead over it.  If I have something I like, I then output it to Sonar to play with some more.Pros- Small, very easy to use (1 level knob and a stomp button), designed by guitarists and it shows, true bypass and plenty of room for recording.Cons- You may consider lack of battery a con, I don't, everything goes on the effects rack and is powered through AC.  No drum track or click track but then again, the aim for this device was to keep is simple, I believe.UPDATE: I was having an issue with the looper one night being able to record but not hear myself.  I contacted support and their response was quick but they basically said it sounds like it is broken, replace at the store which I did.  It worked great then one night again, I couldn't hear myself recording.  I played for about an hour with different configurations, it seems not all 9V AC adapters are equal.

If it doesn't take batteries, that's fine, but give me an adapter.  This thing was over a hundred dollars. Don't force me to buy an accessory just to power it up.2) Personally I wish there was an option to remove layers in the order they were added (not just removing the last layer, or all the layers).  I'd like to be able to build up a song with layer on top of layer- moving to a crescendo - and then back off the layers one at a time, eventually returning to a single layer.  I played a solo at church with this thing and the congregation loved it.  I started with one part, and then added layer after layer until I had a really big intricate sound.

I purchased headphones because I figured it was a more pleasant way to listen to music at work than in-ear type. I chose this model because they were on sale, seemed to be a diamond in the rough, and reviews indicated it would be good for large heads(I wear an XL hat size).The build is average. They don't feel flimsy in my hands, but you can see the plastic parts are nothing special, strength-wise. The padding for the headband is a little uneven on the seam, as you open up the headband to put the unit on your head, it sort of looks warped. The 3 meter cable is attached to the base of the left headphone. The headphones can both swivel 90 degrees forward, maybe 35 degrees back, and 90 degrees downward. The swivel joint above the ear pieces allow them to fold upward into the headband.I listened to about 45 minutes of music straight to start, and was pretty pleased. I'm not especially particular, but do like good sound. There's some good bass, classical music was clear. The headphones did make me realize I had low quality recordings for a few of my songs that I tried out(listening to the HD equivalent on YouTube cleared up problems I heard). I wasn't totally blown away, either. I do hear a little noise when they're plugged into my computer and nothing is playing, though not so for my iPod(so I'm not sure if this can be blamed on the headphones).They are comfortable, but not as comfortable as I'd like. I do feel some pushing against my ears, the round ear pads aren't big enough to fit my whole ear. They do get warmer than I'd like. I definitely feel relieved to have them off. I think they are noticeably uncomfortable after about an hour. I was a little hesitant to get over-ear headphones in fear of this, and unfortunately it did turn out to be a problem.Who knows, maybe they'll wear in and improve. I'll update this review if I have more to report. For now, I'd say they're worth the cost, even if they aren't a shining diamond in the rough. If I could give about 3.5 stars I would; but for now, I'll give 3. They are accurately priced, and overall a typical quality product. Some exceptional pros are balanced by some cons.Update 7/19:I've been stretching out the headphones on a box for a couple days, it's helped a bit. What's funny is that the adjustable portion can get huge! It's comfortable on my head at about the 3rd of the 10 size notches...but the pushing against your head is the tight part. If you adjust them larger, they just fall below your ears, rather than loosen up.Also, I compared them to the Sennheiser HD201. The TASCAMs have better sound, but the Sennheiser is more comfortable(they're lighter and the ear cups are oval shaped and fit better).Update 7/23:I think the box stretching has been helping, I'm able to wear them for about 2 hours now before I notice them getting uncomfortable. Still a relatively short amount of time.Update 8/9/2013:The headphones have been living on a box just wider than my head anytime they aren't in use. The comfort is marginally improving, I'm guessing due to the stretching out, my head/ears getting used to the pressure, and me learning ways to sort of adjust them periodically to shift the pressure. However, I think my rating will remain at 3 stars. The sound is good enough to give it a couple stars, and the price low enough for one more. However, a month should be long enough for the phones to break-in to a standard usable degree, and that hasn't happened to my satisfaction.CONCLUSION: I would suggest you find a different pair if you have an exceptionally big head(mine is about 24\"/61cm circumference, or US hat size 7 and 5/8). The clamping definitely leads to discomfort, the round ear pads don't quite do the trick, and it makes your head pretty warm. It's not unbearable, but if you can find an alternative it's probably best. That being said, note that I have only reduced stars for the fit!! I can't speak for someone with a bit smaller of a head(and ears?)...if these fit comfortably, which I imagine they would for many people, they are a 5 star product! Great sounding, sturdy enough build, etc.Update 11/14/13:A friend of mine picked up a pair of Audio-Technica M50s around the same time I bought this pair, and I was able to try them out and compare for a good half hour today. I'm not very experienced with sound quality, but I felt that the M50s were definitely the winner. The most obvious difference was the added volume, but generally the sound was more pleasing to my ears. The bass seemed more supported, higher notes felt smoother and less static-like, etc. Besides the volume, these differences weren't huge. I had to compare somewhat carefully to notice them. The point of this update is just to say that you aren't getting $150 headphones for $30 with the TASCAMs. You are getting very good headphones, the sound of which should more than satisfy most people. I think you're pursuing diminishing returns in sound quality alone to pay much more than this for headphones(in this case, you'd pay 5X more for the M50s...but I don't think you're getting 5X the sound quality). The M50s are significantly more comfortable(though they do make your ears warmer), and the build feels better(stronger, smoother adjustments, prettier, etc.). All these things combined, and you may start to consider the price difference reasonable.","summary":"Decent value","unixReviewTime":1373932800,"reviewTime":"07 16, 2013"}

But for practicing in your bedroom or similar it's perfect. Plenty of sound effects to mess around with. Are they as good as dedicated $100 per stomp box effects? Probably not, but so what. Just found out the best part of this amp. You can connect it via the USB port to your PC not only for using the rather cheesy Fender software, but it lets you pipe your guitar's sounds into software like Garage Band. You can thus save yourself a dedicated audio interface like an M-Audio M-Track or similar. PS: It is not recommended to go directly from the guitar to the MIC or LINE IN in of your computer (even with the right adapter plugs) as the impedances will not be right. On top of that, I have connected the Mac's headphone audio out to the amp's AUX in! Sounds MUCH better than listening to the PC's normal puny speakers.UPDATE: While the built in USB interface does work, a dedicated device with good pre-amps like the Focusrite 2i2 is much better in getting guitar audio into a computer.UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: While I am keeping this amp for convenience I have quickly learned that NOTHING can match a real tube amp. You can simulate all you want (and I am talking much more expensive SW solutions, its like imitation chocolate vs. REAL chocolate. Got the Marshall DSL 40 Watt combo. Amazing sound.","summary":"Great deal for what it is. You can save yourself a separate guitar audio USB box with this amp!","unixReviewTime":1380412800,"reviewTime":"09 29, 2013"}

In addition to the bass-heavy delivery, there seems to be a dip in the upper mids, a boost in the low mids, and a rolling off of the high end.  This just doesn't work for me in the studio.  The overall size of the headphones is large and they won't fit well for people with smaller heads.  I had some people try them on and they all stated that the earpieces went down too far and didn't fit on their ears properly.  I checked to make sure that they were retracted to their smallest size and they were.This is a shame, as TASCAM make some fine products and are a good name.  I have owned four DA-88 recorders, many field recorders, and three different portable recorders from them, all of which have been great. I am certainly not saying anything bad about the company, but their headphones are just put out there to be low-priced headphones that are not suited to a professional studio.I have used theSony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone [Electronics] for decades now and I still recommend them.  I have had the same pairs for over 20 years and they are all still going strong, barring replacing the ear padding.  The Sony headphones do not cost a tremendous amount more, and they are worth every penny if you are doing studio work.I would also recommend theAKG K 240 MK II Stereo Studio HeadphonesorAKG K 240 Semi-Open Studio Headphonesover the TASCAM reviewed here.  The AKG perform much better when you are using a headphone amplifier though, so that would need to be taken into account.","summary":"Bass-heavy with dull highs","unixReviewTime":1377216000,"reviewTime":"08 23, 2013"}

This is not to be confused with the Amplitube iRig which achieves input and output through the iPad/iOS devices headphone jack. Headphone connections can be noisy and have reliable connection problems. They also depend on the built in AD/DA converters in the iPad/iOS device. This Apogee Jam 96k is a professional quality INPUT device that has dedicated A/D analogue to digital converter, but depends on the built in hardware of the iPad/iOS device for playback. On the other hand &#34;Apogee One&#34; has both AD and DA convertors for both input and output.Amplitube iRig from IK Multimedia has a simple stereo headphone in and out jack plug that plugs into your iPad. The built in hardware in the iPad is something that I love for doing something like watching a movie cozying up to the 10 inch screen, but for audio-phile quality you need a dedicated a dedicated pre and AD convertor and that is what this Apogee Jam 96k has. Mind you it has that for audio recording input, but playback is handled via your headphone jack on your iPad. You can of course just use that for monitoring your mix, and then save the file in a digital format internally, and send to a playback device with pristine digital audio quality; e.g. saving as a .Wav file. This makes the Apogee 96k Jam a very usable device to achieve high quality recordings at a very nice price.So here it the continuum. Amplitube iRig for headphone jack input and output quality built into your iPad etc. The Apogee Jam 96k for digital quality conversion on input only with playback being handled by headphone jack on iPad. The Apogee One on the other hand at roughly 3 times the price gives you both AD/DA conversions so it has its own audio output jack plus 2 tracks of recording either 1/4&#34; instrument and/or a balanced external microphone jack. It also comes with a built in condenser mic that is pretty amazing. It also has 48 volt phantom power for using your favorite condenser mic. When you get into the Apogee Duet and Quartet you get more connections, plus the all too important option of MIDI connectivity.","summary":"Getting in the door with Apogees incredible sound quality at an incredible price.","unixReviewTime":1405296000,"reviewTime":"07 14, 2014"}

Edelman","helpful":"[1, 1]","reviewText":"I've been recording on my iMac, iPod Touch, iPad, and iPhone for some time, using Garage Band. Interfacing with the iMac is easy, using various USB devices- I'm currently using a USB-equipped Alesis preamp. iOS device interface is a bit more difficult; it is possible to use USB preamps, with an externally powered USB hub, but that starts getting very complicated and messy.  I've been using simple devices like the 1K that  split the headphone/microphone jack into two separate cords, one for headphone, and one for guitar. The problem with this sort of configuration is that it's very easy to overload the microphone input, and the recording quality done this way is not very good. The Apogee JAM is a big improvement over this method for a number of reasons. First, it contains its own dedicated preamp and A/D, and because of that it delivers a wide dynamic range and excellent fidelity. Interface issues are non-existent; plugged into both the iPad and iPhone it was immediately recognized. I didn't have any problems with either of the three supplied cables.The JAM is significantly more expensive than the simple interfaces, but on the whole I think it's worth it. It's simple to use, has no detectable latency, and delivers excellent sound quality. It does seem to draw a fair amount of current, and battery life  is shortened significantly when using this with an iPhone. You'll want to plan on more frequent than usual recharging sessions. With the iPad, this isn't as noticeable. Even with that issue, I think the JAM is a good value.  The various iOS devices are capable of making very high quality recordings, but only with quality input. Given the cost of an new iPhone or iPad, the cost of the JAM is rather trivial in comparison.","summary":"Excellent sound, low latency, plug and play","unixReviewTime":1403395200,"reviewTime":"06 22, 2014"}
